        <p>Four areas of law. One coordinated strategy for your family.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #333340;">Most firms treat each legal matter as a standalone project. We take a different approach. Our attorneys practice across four interconnected areas — because your business is an estate planning asset, your real estate is part of your estate, and a death in the family can touch all four. When one firm handles everything, the connections are preserved and the gaps that cause problems are eliminated.</p>
