<h2>Legal Services for Wexford, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Wexford is one of the fastest-growing and most desirable communities in the Pittsburgh region, anchored by the Pine-Richland School District and a thriving commercial corridor along Route 19. The area attracts young professionals, growing families, business owners, and executives — many of whom need coordinated legal services across estate planning, real estate, and business law. Ament Law Group serves Wexford clients from our Murrysville office, bringing the same integrated approach that has served Western Pennsylvania families for over fifty years.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Wexford Families</h2>

<p>Wexford's mix of young families and established professionals creates diverse planning needs. For families with minor children, the most urgent priorities are guardian nominations, life insurance coordination, and basic estate documents — a will, financial power of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, and healthcare power of attorney. For more established families, planning may include revocable living trusts to avoid probate on real estate, irrevocable trusts for asset protection, education trusts, and business succession provisions.</p>

<p>We see a significant number of Wexford families with dual-income households, employer stock options, multiple retirement accounts, and investment properties. These families need estate plans that coordinate beneficiary designations across all of these accounts — not just a will that sits in a drawer. A single outdated beneficiary form can override the entire plan, and we make sure every piece fits together.</p>

<h2>Probate & Trust Administration</h2>

<p>Wexford falls within Allegheny County, so estates are administered through the Register of Wills at the City-County Building in downtown Pittsburgh. We handle will filing, Short Certificate issuance, creditor and beneficiary notification under 20 Pa.C.S. § 3162, asset collection and inventory, Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500) preparation, and final distribution. For families who have fully funded revocable trusts, we guide trustees through the trust administration process — often simpler and less expensive than probate.</p>

<h2>Real Estate</h2>

<p>Wexford's active housing market — from new construction in developments off Route 19 to established neighborhoods throughout Pine and Marshall Townships — keeps our real estate practice busy. We provide full settlement services as licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, handling title searches, title insurance, closing documents, and deed recording with the Allegheny County Department of Real Estate. We also handle deed transfers for families moving property into trusts or LLCs, analyzing transfer tax exemptions to minimize costs.</p>

<h2>Business Law</h2>

<p>The Route 19 corridor is home to a growing number of professional practices, small businesses, and startups. We assist Wexford business owners with LLC and corporation formation through the Pennsylvania Department of State, operating agreements, commercial lease review, buy-sell agreements, and annual compliance including CROP filings and decennial reports. For business owners approaching retirement or planning for the unexpected, we integrate business succession planning directly into the estate plan — so the transition is covered whether it happens by choice or by circumstance.</p>
