<h2>Legal Services for Greensburg, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Greensburg — the county seat of Westmoreland County — is home to the courthouse where probate matters are filed, Seton Hill University, Westmoreland County Community College, and a vibrant downtown business district. Ament Law Group serves Greensburg and the surrounding Hempfield Township community with estate planning, probate administration, real estate closings, elder law, and business counsel. Because the Westmoreland County Register of Wills, Recorder of Deeds, and Court of Common Pleas are all located in the Greensburg courthouse, we are in these offices regularly on behalf of our clients.</p>

<p>Greensburg's diverse community — from families in Hempfield's established neighborhoods to professionals working at Excela Westmoreland Hospital, the county courts, and the universities — creates a broad range of legal needs. Whether you need to plan your estate, administer a loved one's estate, close on a home, or structure a business, our attorneys bring the Westmoreland County-specific knowledge your matter requires.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning</h2>

<p>We prepare wills, trusts, powers of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, and healthcare directives for Greensburg families. Our plans are tailored to each client's circumstances — addressing guardianship for minor children, asset protection for blended families, business succession, charitable giving, and special needs planning. For Greensburg professionals and business owners, we coordinate estate plans with employer benefits, retirement accounts, and business ownership interests to ensure everything works together.</p>

<h2>Probate and Estate Administration</h2>

<p>As the county seat, the Westmoreland County Register of Wills in Greensburg is where all local estates are filed. Our attorneys are at the Greensburg courthouse frequently and have well-established working relationships with the Register's office. We guide executors and administrators through will filing, Short Certificate issuance, creditor notification, inheritance tax preparation (REV-1500 for Pennsylvania, plus federal returns when applicable), and final distributions. For complex estates involving real property, business interests, or family disputes, we provide the experience and attention needed to navigate these challenges efficiently.</p>

<h2>Real Estate and Business Services</h2>

<p>As licensed title agents through Chicago Title and First American, we handle closings for Greensburg and Hempfield Township buyers and sellers — from title search through deed recording at the Westmoreland County Recorder of Deeds in the Greensburg courthouse. Our business law practice serves Greensburg's entrepreneurs, medical professionals, and established businesses with entity formation, contract drafting, commercial lease review, and succession planning.</p>

<h2>Elder Law and Medicaid Planning</h2>

<p>Greensburg's proximity to major healthcare facilities, including Excela Westmoreland Hospital and multiple skilled nursing facilities, means many families face long-term care planning decisions. We help Greensburg families protect their assets through Medicaid planning — addressing the five-year look-back period, community spouse protections, and both proactive and crisis planning strategies. When guardianship is needed for an incapacitated adult, we handle the petition before the Westmoreland County Orphans' Court in Greensburg.</p>

We combine local courthouse familiarity with flexible scheduling, transparent pricing, and a commitment to treating every client's matter with the attention it deserves.
