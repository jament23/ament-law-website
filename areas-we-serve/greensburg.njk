                <h2>Serving Greensburg and the County Seat</h2>
                <p>As the seat of Westmoreland County, Greensburg is home to the county courthouse and the Register of Wills — two institutions our attorneys work with regularly. Ament Law Group's Murrysville office is a short drive east on Route 22, giving Greensburg residents convenient access to experienced estate planning, probate, and real estate counsel.</p>

                <h2>Probate & Estate Administration in Greensburg</h2>
                <p>When a Greensburg resident passes away, the estate typically must be administered through the Westmoreland County Register of Wills in the Greensburg courthouse. Our attorneys handle every aspect of this process, from filing the initial petition and obtaining Short Certificates to preparing and filing the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500) and the final accounting with the Orphans' Court.</p>
                <p>We understand the specific procedures of the Westmoreland County Register of Wills office and maintain strong working relationships with court staff, which helps us move our clients' matters through the system efficiently.</p>

                <h2>Estate Planning for Greensburg Families</h2>
                <p>A well-drafted estate plan gives Greensburg families peace of mind. We prepare wills, revocable living trusts, durable powers of attorney, and healthcare directives that reflect Pennsylvania law and each client's unique circumstances. We also counsel clients on strategies to minimize Pennsylvania inheritance tax exposure and, where appropriate, avoid or simplify the probate process.</p>

                <h2>Real Estate & Business Services</h2>
                <p>Greensburg's real estate market includes everything from historic homes near Seton Hill to newer developments in Hempfield Township. Our attorneys handle residential and commercial closings as licensed title insurance agents. We also serve Greensburg's business community with entity formation, operating agreements, and contract review.</p>
