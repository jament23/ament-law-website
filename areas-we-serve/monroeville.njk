                <h2>Serving Monroeville from Nearby Murrysville</h2>
                <p>Monroeville sits at the crossroads of Allegheny and Westmoreland Counties — and Ament Law Group's office is just a few miles east on Route 22. That proximity makes us a convenient choice for Monroeville residents who want experienced, personal legal counsel without fighting traffic into downtown Pittsburgh.</p>
                <p>Whether you live near the Monroeville Mall, in the Garden City neighborhoods, or anywhere in the municipality, we provide the same attentive service our clients have relied on for decades.</p>

                <h2>Estate Planning & Probate</h2>
                <p>Monroeville falls within Allegheny County, which means estate matters are administered through the Allegheny County Register of Wills in the City-County Building in downtown Pittsburgh. Our attorneys are experienced with Allegheny County probate procedures and regularly handle matters in both Allegheny and Westmoreland Counties, giving Monroeville residents seamless service regardless of which county their assets are located in.</p>
                <p>We prepare comprehensive estate plans including wills, revocable living trusts, powers of attorney, and healthcare directives — all tailored to Pennsylvania law and each family's specific needs.</p>

                <h2>Real Estate Closings</h2>
                <p>Monroeville's real estate market ranges from established neighborhoods to newer developments in surrounding communities. As licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, we handle closings for buyers, sellers, and refinancing clients throughout Monroeville and the Route 22 corridor.</p>

                <h2>Business Law</h2>
                <p>From sole proprietorships along Business Route 22 to larger operations in the Monroeville Business Park, we help local business owners with entity formation, operating agreements, commercial leases, and contract review.</p>
