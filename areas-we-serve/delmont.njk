                <h2>Your Neighbors in Westmoreland County</h2>
                <p>Delmont and Export sit just minutes from our Murrysville office, making Ament Law Group a natural choice for families in Salem and Washington Townships. Our attorneys have deep roots in the community and understand the priorities of families in this part of Westmoreland County.</p>

                <h2>Estate Planning & Probate</h2>
                <p>We help Delmont and Export families protect their assets with wills, revocable living trusts, powers of attorney, and healthcare directives. When it comes to probate, we handle the entire process through the Westmoreland County Register of Wills — from the initial filing through inheritance tax preparation and the final accounting.</p>
                <p>For families with farmland, business interests, or property in multiple municipalities, we build estate plans that account for the full picture and minimize unnecessary tax exposure.</p>

                <h2>Real Estate & Business Law</h2>
                <p>Delmont and Export continue to attract families looking for the balance of rural character and suburban convenience. Our attorneys handle residential and commercial closings as licensed title insurance agents, and we provide business formation and contract services for local entrepreneurs.</p>
