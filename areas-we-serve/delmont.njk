<h2>Legal Services for Delmont, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Delmont Borough and surrounding Salem Township are part of the close-knit Westmoreland County communities we have served for decades. Located just east of our Murrysville office along Route 22, Delmont residents benefit from quick access to our full range of legal services — estate planning, probate administration, real estate closings, and business counsel. Delmont's mix of established neighborhoods, family farms, and growing commercial development along the Route 22 corridor creates diverse legal needs that our attorneys are well equipped to handle.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning</h2>

<p>We prepare complete estate plans for Delmont families, including Last Wills and Testaments compliant with 20 Pa.C.S. § 2502, durable financial powers of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, advance healthcare directives, and revocable living trusts when appropriate. Delmont residents with agricultural property or family land face unique planning considerations — including how to pass real estate to the next generation while minimizing inheritance tax exposure and avoiding the need for all heirs to agree on the future of the property. We address these issues head-on with strategies tailored to your family's assets and goals.</p>

<h2>Probate and Estate Administration</h2>

<p>When a Delmont resident passes, the estate is administered through the Westmoreland County Register of Wills in Greensburg. We guide executors and administrators through every step of the process — from filing the will and obtaining Short Certificates, through creditor notification, asset inventory, inheritance tax filing (REV-1500), and final distribution to beneficiaries. For estates that include real property in Salem Township or surrounding areas, we handle the deed transfers and coordinate any necessary title work as part of the administration.</p>

<h2>Real Estate and Business Services</h2>

<p>As licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, we handle real estate closings for Delmont buyers and sellers, including title searches, settlement services, and deed recording. Our business law practice serves Delmont's entrepreneurs and small business owners with entity formation, operating agreements, contract review, and succession planning. We also assist with commercial lease negotiations for businesses in the Delmont area.</p>

<h2>Why Delmont Families Trust Ament Law Group</h2>

<p>Our office at 3950 Wm Penn Highway in Murrysville is a straight shot west on Route 22 from Delmont — convenient for in-person meetings, with the flexibility of remote consultations when that works better for your schedule. We offer transparent billing with all fees discussed upfront, and our attorneys take the time to explain every option in plain language so you can make informed decisions about your legal matters.</p>

<h2>Elder Law and Medicaid Planning</h2>

<p>Delmont's aging population means that more families are facing long-term care decisions. We help families plan for the cost of nursing home care through Medicaid planning strategies, including asset protection trusts, spend-down planning, and community spouse protections. Pennsylvania's five-year look-back period for Medicaid eligibility makes early planning essential — the sooner you begin, the more options are available to protect your family's assets while ensuring access to quality care.</p>

<h2>Serving Delmont and Salem Township</h2>

<p>Delmont families benefit from our familiarity with the Westmoreland County courthouse in nearby Greensburg, where probate matters are filed and real estate deeds are recorded. Whether you need to plan your estate, settle a loved one's affairs, close on a home in Salem Township, or form a business, our attorneys bring the same local knowledge and personal commitment to every Delmont client we serve.</p>
