<h2>Legal Services for Plum Borough, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Plum Borough is a thriving residential community in eastern Allegheny County, bordered by Murrysville, Penn Hills, and Monroeville. With its mix of established neighborhoods, newer developments, and easy access to the Pennsylvania Turnpike and Route 286, Plum is home to families and small businesses with legal needs that span estate planning, probate, real estate, and business law. Ament Law Group serves Plum Borough clients from our Murrysville office — just minutes away across the county line.</p>

<p>Because Plum sits at the border of Allegheny and Westmoreland Counties, many Plum families own property or have financial ties in both jurisdictions. Our attorneys regularly handle matters in both counties, which means Plum residents get counsel that understands the procedures at the Allegheny County Register of Wills in downtown Pittsburgh as well as the Westmoreland County offices in Greensburg.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Plum Families</h2>

<p>We help Plum Borough residents build estate plans that protect their families and reflect their actual goals. Our services include wills, durable powers of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, healthcare directives, and revocable living trusts when appropriate. Whether you are a young family establishing your first estate plan or a retired couple looking to update documents created years ago, we tailor every plan to the client's specific circumstances — not a template.</p>

<h2>Probate and Estate Administration</h2>

<p>Plum Borough estates are generally administered through the Allegheny County Register of Wills at the City-County Building in downtown Pittsburgh. We guide executors and administrators through every step — filing the will, obtaining Short Certificates, notifying creditors, inventorying assets, preparing the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500), and making distributions to beneficiaries. For estates with property in Westmoreland County, we handle the ancillary filings and coordinate across both jurisdictions.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Closings</h2>

<p>Plum Borough's residential market — from homes along Old William Penn Highway to newer neighborhoods near Logans Ferry — benefits from our full settlement services. As licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, we conduct title searches, issue title insurance policies, prepare closing documents, and attend settlement. We record deeds with the Allegheny County Department of Real Estate and coordinate with lenders and agents to keep every closing on schedule.</p>

<h2>Business Law</h2>

<p>Plum Borough's growing business community — from professional offices along Route 286 to contractors, medical practices, and family-owned businesses — needs solid legal foundations. We help Plum business owners with LLC and corporation formation, operating agreements, contract review, commercial lease negotiations, and succession planning. As outside general counsel, we provide the legal support your business needs without the overhead of a full-time in-house attorney.</p>

<h2>Why Plum Residents Choose Ament Law Group</h2>

<p>Our Murrysville office is right next door to Plum Borough — closer than most downtown Pittsburgh firms and far easier to reach. We combine deep familiarity with both Allegheny and Westmoreland County legal procedures with transparent pricing, flexible scheduling, and a personal approach that treats every client as a priority. Many of our Plum clients came to us through referrals from neighbors and friends, and we work to earn that trust every day.</p>
