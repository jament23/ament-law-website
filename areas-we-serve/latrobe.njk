                <h2>Serving the Greater Latrobe Community</h2>
                <p>Latrobe is one of Westmoreland County's most storied communities — home to Saint Vincent College, the Westmoreland County Airshow, and a proud tradition of close-knit families. Ament Law Group serves Greater Latrobe residents from our Murrysville office, a straightforward drive west on Route 30.</p>

                <h2>Estate Planning & Probate</h2>
                <p>Many Latrobe families have property and assets that have been in the family for generations. We help preserve that legacy with carefully drafted wills, revocable living trusts, and powers of attorney. When a loved one passes, we guide executors through the Westmoreland County probate process — from the Register of Wills in Greensburg through the final accounting.</p>
                <p>For families with agricultural land, business interests, or complex asset structures, we develop estate plans that address Pennsylvania inheritance tax implications and succession planning.</p>

                <h2>Real Estate & Business Law</h2>
                <p>Whether you're purchasing a home in Unity Township, closing on commercial property along Route 30, or forming a business in the Greater Latrobe area, our attorneys provide the legal foundation you need. We serve as licensed title insurance agents and handle closings, title searches, and real estate disputes.</p>
