<h2>Legal Services for Latrobe, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Latrobe — home to Saint Vincent College, the Westmoreland County Airpark, and a proud tradition of industry and community — is one of the larger municipalities in eastern Westmoreland County. Ament Law Group serves Latrobe and Unity Township families and businesses with estate planning, probate administration, real estate closings, and business law. Our Murrysville office is approximately 20 minutes west along Route 30, making us conveniently accessible while still providing the deep Westmoreland County knowledge that Latrobe clients need.</p>

<p>Latrobe's established neighborhoods, growing healthcare and education sectors, and vibrant small business community create a range of legal needs. Whether you are a physician at Excela Latrobe Hospital planning your estate, a business owner on Ligonier Street reviewing a commercial lease, or a family dealing with a loved one's passing, our attorneys bring the expertise and personal attention your situation requires.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Latrobe Families</h2>

<p>Our estate planning services for Latrobe residents include wills compliant with 20 Pa.C.S. § 2502, durable powers of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, advance healthcare directives, and revocable living trusts. For professionals and business owners in the Latrobe area, we also address business succession planning, buy-sell agreement coordination, and strategies for minimizing Pennsylvania inheritance tax on larger estates. Every plan is customized to your family's specific circumstances — we never use generic templates or one-size-fits-all packages.</p>

<h2>Probate and Estate Administration</h2>

<p>Latrobe estates are administered through the Westmoreland County Register of Wills at the courthouse in Greensburg. We handle the full probate process for executors and administrators, including will filing, Short Certificate issuance, creditor notification, asset inventory and appraisal, inheritance tax return preparation (REV-1500), and final distribution. For Latrobe families dealing with the loss of a loved one, we manage the legal details so you can focus on your family.</p>

<h2>Real Estate and Business Services</h2>

<p>As licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, we conduct real estate closings for Latrobe buyers and sellers across the residential and commercial spectrum. Our business law practice serves Latrobe's entrepreneurs with LLC and corporation formation, operating agreements, contract review, and ongoing business counsel. We also assist with commercial real estate transactions, including lease drafting and review for businesses along Latrobe's commercial corridors.</p>

<h2>Elder Law and Medicaid Planning</h2>

<p>With Excela Latrobe Hospital and multiple skilled nursing facilities in the greater Latrobe area, many families face long-term care planning decisions. We help families protect their assets through Medicaid planning strategies — including irrevocable trusts, spend-down planning, and community spouse protections — while ensuring that their loved one qualifies for the care they need. Pennsylvania's five-year look-back period makes early planning critical, but we also offer crisis planning when care is needed immediately.</p>

<h2>Conveniently Accessible from Latrobe</h2>

<p>Our Murrysville office is easily reached from Latrobe via Route 30 West or the PA Turnpike. We offer flexible scheduling, including evening appointments, and can conduct consultations remotely when travel is inconvenient. All fees are discussed and agreed upon before work begins, whether flat-rate or hourly.</p>

<h2>Serving the Greater Latrobe Community</h2>

<p>Our practice extends throughout the greater Latrobe area, including Unity Township, Derry Township, and Ligonier. Whether you need to plan your estate, administer a family member's affairs through the Westmoreland County Register of Wills, close on a home, or structure a business, we bring the same combination of legal expertise and personal attention to every Latrobe-area client. Many of our Latrobe clients were referred by neighbors, colleagues, or financial advisors who have seen the quality of our work firsthand.</p>
