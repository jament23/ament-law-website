<h2>Legal Services for Fox Chapel, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Fox Chapel Borough is one of the most affluent communities in Western Pennsylvania, known for its large estates, wooded lots, and proximity to Pittsburgh. Families in Fox Chapel frequently have complex financial profiles — multiple real estate holdings, business interests, investment portfolios, and multi-generational wealth considerations — that require legal counsel spanning estate planning, tax strategy, real estate, and business law. Ament Law Group serves Fox Chapel clients across all of these practice areas from our Murrysville office, a short drive east along Route 28.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Fox Chapel Families</h2>

<p>Fox Chapel families often require estate plans that go beyond a basic will. We regularly work with clients whose planning needs include revocable living trusts to avoid probate on high-value real estate, irrevocable trusts for asset protection and estate tax mitigation, generation-skipping trust provisions, coordination of multiple retirement accounts and investment portfolios, and business succession planning. We also address Pennsylvania inheritance tax planning under 72 P.S. § 9101 et seq. — with particular attention to the strategies available to minimize the 4.5% lineal heir rate and the 15% rate for non-lineal beneficiaries.</p>

<p>For families with children, we draft guardian nominations, educational trusts, and provisions that protect inherited assets from divorce, creditors, and poor financial decisions. Every plan is tailored to the family's actual circumstances — not built from a template.</p>

<h2>Probate & Trust Administration</h2>

<p>Fox Chapel estates are administered through the Allegheny County Register of Wills at the City-County Building in downtown Pittsburgh. We guide executors and trustees through every phase — Short Certificate issuance, creditor notification, asset inventory, Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500) preparation, federal estate tax filings when applicable, and final distribution. For larger estates, we coordinate with CPAs and financial advisors to manage tax elections, valuation discounts, and disclaimer planning.</p>

<p>For families with funded revocable trusts, we handle the trust administration process — retitling assets, managing trustee duties, and making distributions according to the trust terms — often allowing the family to avoid probate entirely on the trust-funded assets.</p>

<h2>Real Estate</h2>

<p>Fox Chapel's residential real estate market includes some of the highest-value properties in the Pittsburgh region. We provide full settlement services for buyers and sellers, including title searches, title insurance through Chicago Title and First American, closing document preparation, and deed recording with the Allegheny County Department of Real Estate. We also handle deed transfers to trusts, LLCs, and family members — with careful attention to transfer tax exemptions under 72 P.S. § 8102-C that can save thousands on high-value properties.</p>

<h2>Business Law</h2>

<p>Many Fox Chapel residents are business owners, physicians, executives, and professionals with entity structuring needs. We handle LLC and corporation formation, operating agreements, buy-sell agreements, and ongoing corporate counsel. For clients whose business interests intersect with their estate planning — which is nearly always — we coordinate entity documents, succession provisions, and buy-sell funding with the overall estate plan.</p>
