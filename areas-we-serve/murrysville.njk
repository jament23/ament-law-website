<h2>Your Neighborhood Law Firm</h2>

<p>Ament Law Group has called Murrysville home for decades. Our office at 3950 William Penn Highway sits in the heart of the community we serve — the same community where our attorneys live, coach youth sports, and raise their families. Murrysville residents choose us because we combine the deep local knowledge of a neighborhood practice with the legal expertise their families and businesses deserve.</p>

<p>Whether you are a young family in Franklin Farms or the Sardis Woods neighborhood planning your first estate, a business owner in the William Penn Highway corridor, or a long-time resident of the Murrysville Estates area updating your will after a major life change, we provide personal, experienced legal counsel tailored to your needs.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Murrysville Families</h2>

<p>We prepare comprehensive estate plans for Murrysville families — wills compliant with Pennsylvania's requirements under 20 Pa.C.S. § 2502, durable financial powers of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, advance healthcare directives, and revocable living trusts when they serve the client's goals. Murrysville's families range from young parents in the Franklin Regional School District who need guardianship provisions, to established professionals coordinating complex asset portfolios, to retirees focused on inheritance tax minimization and long-term care planning. We tailor every plan to the specific family we are working with.</p>

<p>For Murrysville homeowners concerned about whether they need a trust, we provide straightforward advice based on your actual situation — not a sales pitch. In many cases, a well-drafted will combined with properly coordinated beneficiary designations and joint ownership accomplishes the client's goals without the added expense of a trust. When a trust does make sense — for families with real property in multiple states, special needs beneficiaries, or specific distribution concerns — we explain exactly why and how it fits your plan.</p>

<h2>Probate and Estate Administration</h2>

<p>When a Murrysville resident passes, the estate is administered through the Westmoreland County Register of Wills at the courthouse in Greensburg. We guide executors and administrators through every step: filing the will, obtaining Short Certificates, publishing creditor notices in the legal journal, inventorying and appraising assets, preparing the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500), and distributing the estate to beneficiaries. We take the time to explain each stage so that executors understand their responsibilities and avoid the personal liability that can result from procedural errors.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Closings</h2>

<p>As licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, we handle residential closings throughout Murrysville and Westmoreland County. Our services include title searches, title insurance issuance, document preparation, settlement attendance, and deed recording with the Westmoreland County Recorder of Deeds. Whether you are buying your first home in Murrysville, selling a family property, or refinancing an existing mortgage, we ensure the transaction is handled properly from contract to closing.</p>

<h2>Business Law</h2>

<p>Murrysville's William Penn Highway corridor is home to professional practices, retail businesses, contractors, and service providers that need reliable legal counsel. We help Murrysville business owners with LLC and corporation formation through the Pennsylvania Department of State, operating agreements and bylaws, contract drafting and review, commercial lease negotiations, and business succession planning. For businesses that need ongoing legal support, we serve as outside general counsel — available when you need us, without the expense of a full-time in-house attorney.</p>

<h2>Elder Law and Medicaid Planning</h2>

<p>As families age, long-term care planning becomes increasingly important. We help Murrysville families protect their assets through Medicaid planning, guardianship proceedings when necessary, and coordination between elder law strategies and existing estate plans. With nursing home costs in Western Pennsylvania exceeding $12,000 per month, planning ahead — ideally at least five years before care is needed — can save families tens of thousands of dollars while ensuring access to quality care.</p>

<h2>Conveniently Located on Route 22</h2>

<p>Our office is easily accessible from Route 22 (William Penn Highway) and just minutes from the PA Turnpike interchange. We offer flexible scheduling, including evening and weekend appointments for clients who cannot get away during the workday. Our fees are always transparent — discussed and agreed upon before work begins, whether flat-rate or hourly — so you know exactly what to expect.</p>
