<h2>Legal Services for Churchill and Forest Hills, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Churchill Borough and Forest Hills Borough are established residential communities in eastern Allegheny County, situated along the I-376 corridor between Monroeville and the City of Pittsburgh. With their tree-lined streets, strong school communities, and convenient access to downtown Pittsburgh and the eastern suburbs, Churchill and Forest Hills are home to families and professionals with legal needs spanning estate planning, probate, real estate, and business law. Ament Law Group serves Churchill and Forest Hills clients from our Murrysville office, a short drive east along I-376 or Route 22.</p>

<p>Both boroughs are part of the Woodland Hills School District and share close ties with neighboring Wilkinsburg, Edgewood, and Braddock Hills. Residents often have connections across both Allegheny and Westmoreland Counties, and our attorneys are experienced in handling legal matters in both jurisdictions.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Churchill and Forest Hills Families</h2>

<p>We create customized estate plans for Churchill and Forest Hills residents that include wills, durable powers of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, healthcare directives, and trusts when appropriate. Many families in these boroughs include dual-income professionals, retirees managing multiple retirement accounts, and homeowners with significant equity — all situations that benefit from careful, coordinated planning. We ensure your estate plan works as a whole, not as a collection of unrelated documents.</p>

<h2>Probate and Estate Administration</h2>

<p>Churchill and Forest Hills estates are administered through the Allegheny County Register of Wills at the City-County Building in downtown Pittsburgh. We guide executors and administrators through the full process — will filing, Short Certificate issuance, creditor notification, asset inventory, Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return preparation (REV-1500), and final distribution. For estates involving assets in Westmoreland County, we coordinate filings across both courthouses to avoid delays.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Closings</h2>

<p>Churchill and Forest Hills have active residential real estate markets, with homes ranging from classic mid-century properties to updated family homes. As licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, we handle title searches, issue title insurance policies, prepare closing documents, and attend settlement. We also handle deed transfers to trusts, LLCs, and family members — with attention to transfer tax exemptions under 72 P.S. § 8102-C that can save thousands on property transfers.</p>

<h2>Business Law</h2>

<p>Professionals and small business owners in Churchill and Forest Hills rely on sound legal counsel for entity formation, operating agreements, contract review, and succession planning. We help with LLC and corporation formation, buy-sell agreements, commercial leases, and ongoing corporate compliance. For business owners whose personal estate planning needs to coordinate with their business structure — which is nearly always the case — we handle both under one roof.</p>
