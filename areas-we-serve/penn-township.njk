<h2>Legal Services for Penn Township and Harrison City</h2>

<p>Penn Township — home to the Harrison City community — is one of Westmoreland County's most established residential areas, situated along Route 130 just east of our Murrysville office. Families in Penn Township share the same Norwin School District, the same local institutions, and many of the same legal needs as their neighbors in Irwin, North Huntingdon, and Murrysville. Ament Law Group has served Penn Township families and businesses for decades with estate planning, probate administration, real estate closings, and business law.</p>

<p>Penn Township's mix of long-time family properties, newer developments, and local businesses creates a range of legal needs. Whether you are a retired couple in Harrison City updating your estate plan, a young family purchasing their first home in the Brush Creek area, or a contractor running a business along Route 130, we provide the legal services you need from attorneys who understand your community.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning</h2>

<p>We prepare comprehensive estate plans for Penn Township families, including Last Wills and Testaments, durable powers of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, healthcare directives, and revocable living trusts when appropriate. Every plan is tailored to your family's situation — whether that involves providing for minor children, protecting assets for a surviving spouse, planning for a family business, or addressing the needs of a beneficiary who receives government benefits. We also review and update existing plans as your life circumstances change, ensuring your documents always reflect your current wishes and comply with current Pennsylvania law.</p>

<h2>Probate and Estate Administration</h2>

<p>When a Penn Township resident passes away, the estate must be administered through the Westmoreland County Register of Wills in Greensburg. We handle every aspect of the process for executors and administrators — obtaining Short Certificates, notifying creditors through required legal advertisements, inventorying and appraising estate assets, filing the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500), and distributing assets to beneficiaries in accordance with the will or Pennsylvania's intestacy statutes (20 Pa.C.S. § 2101 et seq.). We also advise executors on their fiduciary duties and help them avoid the personal liability that can result from procedural errors.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Closings</h2>

<p>Penn Township's real estate market includes everything from established homes in Harrison City to newer construction in surrounding developments. As licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, we handle residential closings from start to finish — title searches, title insurance, document preparation, settlement attendance, and recording with the Westmoreland County Recorder of Deeds. We represent both buyers and sellers, and we coordinate with lenders and real estate agents to keep every transaction on schedule.</p>

<h2>Business Law and Formation</h2>

<p>Penn Township is home to a diverse range of small businesses, from service providers along Route 130 to home-based enterprises throughout the township. We help Penn Township business owners with LLC and corporation formation, operating agreements and bylaws, contract drafting and review, and ongoing compliance with state and local requirements. For businesses with multiple owners, we draft buy-sell agreements and succession plans that protect every stakeholder.</p>
