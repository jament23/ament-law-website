<h2>Legal Services for the Greater Pittsburgh Area</h2>

<p>While our office is located in Murrysville, we proudly serve clients throughout the greater Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Many Pittsburgh-area families and businesses prefer working with a firm that offers personal attention and practical experience without the overhead and impersonal feel of a large downtown firm.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Pittsburgh Families</h2>

<p>We prepare wills, revocable living trusts, irrevocable trusts, powers of attorney, and healthcare directives for Pittsburgh-area clients. Our attorneys take the time to understand your family's unique situation and build estate plans that work under Pennsylvania law.</p>

<h2>Probate &amp; Estate Administration</h2>

<p>We handle probate filings in both Allegheny County and Westmoreland County, guiding executors through the full administration process — from obtaining Letters Testamentary and Short Certificates to preparing Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax returns and managing distributions.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Closings</h2>

<p>Our licensed title agents handle residential and commercial real estate closings throughout the Pittsburgh region. Whether you're purchasing a home in the eastern suburbs or closing a commercial transaction, we manage title searches, title insurance, and full settlement services.</p>

<h2>Business Formation &amp; Counsel</h2>

<p>Pittsburgh entrepreneurs and small business owners rely on us for LLC and corporation formation, operating agreements, partnership agreements, contract drafting, and ongoing business counsel.</p>
