<h2>Legal Services for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Pittsburgh and the greater Allegheny County area are home to a diverse population of families, professionals, and businesses — all with legal needs that benefit from experienced, personal representation. Ament Law Group serves Pittsburgh-area clients with estate planning, probate administration, real estate closings, and business law. Our Murrysville office is approximately 25 minutes east of downtown Pittsburgh via I-376 and the PA Turnpike, offering a convenient alternative to the congestion and overhead of a downtown firm while providing the same caliber of legal expertise.</p>

<p>Many of our Pittsburgh clients appreciate the combination of suburban accessibility and deep legal knowledge that our firm provides. Whether you live in the eastern suburbs, work downtown but prefer to meet closer to home, or are a Pittsburgh resident with property in Westmoreland County, our attorneys bring experience in both Allegheny County and Westmoreland County procedures.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Pittsburgh Families</h2>

<p>We prepare comprehensive estate plans for Pittsburgh-area residents, including Last Wills and Testaments compliant with 20 Pa.C.S. § 2502, durable financial powers of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, advance healthcare directives, and revocable living trusts. Pittsburgh's professional population often has complex planning needs: multiple retirement accounts, equity compensation, real estate in more than one county, and business interests that require coordination with buy-sell agreements and succession strategies. We design plans that account for every asset and every contingency, ensuring your family is protected.</p>

<h2>Probate and Estate Administration</h2>

<p>Pittsburgh estates are administered through the Allegheny County Register of Wills at the City-County Building in downtown Pittsburgh. We represent executors and administrators through the full process — filing the will, obtaining Short Certificates, notifying creditors, preparing the PA Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500), and distributing assets to beneficiaries. For Pittsburgh families dealing with estates that include property in Westmoreland County or other jurisdictions, we coordinate ancillary probate proceedings to ensure all assets are properly administered and transferred.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Closings</h2>

<p>As licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, we handle residential and commercial real estate closings throughout Allegheny County. Our services include title searches, title insurance issuance, closing document preparation, settlement attendance, and deed recording with the Allegheny County Department of Real Estate. We work with Pittsburgh-area buyers, sellers, and refinancing clients, coordinating with lenders and real estate agents to ensure smooth, timely transactions.</p>

<h2>Business Law</h2>

<p>Pittsburgh's thriving business environment — from tech startups in the Strip District to professional services firms in the eastern suburbs — needs accessible legal support. We serve Pittsburgh business owners with LLC and corporation formation, operating agreements and shareholder agreements, contract drafting and review, business succession planning, and outside general counsel services. For businesses with multiple owners, we draft buy-sell agreements that coordinate with each owner's estate plan to ensure business continuity in any scenario.</p>

<h2>Why Pittsburgh Residents Choose Ament Law Group</h2>

<p>Our clients in Pittsburgh's eastern suburbs — Monroeville, Penn Hills, Forest Hills, Churchill, Wilkinsburg, and surrounding communities — find our Murrysville office more accessible than a downtown firm. We also serve clients from throughout the city who prefer the personal attention of a smaller firm over the impersonal experience of a large downtown practice. We offer flexible scheduling, remote consultations for clients who prefer not to travel, and transparent billing with all fees agreed upon before work begins.</p>
