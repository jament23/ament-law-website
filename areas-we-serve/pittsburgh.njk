                <h2>Serving Pittsburgh's Eastern Suburbs</h2>
                <p>Pittsburgh's eastern suburbs — Plum Borough, Penn Hills, Fox Chapel, Churchill, Wilkins Township, and Forest Hills — sit just west of our Murrysville office along Route 22 and Route 286. Ament Law Group provides experienced legal counsel to families and businesses throughout this corridor, offering an accessible alternative to downtown Pittsburgh firms with the same caliber of legal expertise.</p>

                <h2>Allegheny County Probate & Estate Administration</h2>
                <p>Estates in Pittsburgh and Allegheny County are administered through the Allegheny County Register of Wills in the City-County Building downtown. Our attorneys regularly practice in both Allegheny and Westmoreland Counties, and we handle every aspect of the probate process — petitioning for letters testamentary, obtaining Short Certificates, marshaling assets, preparing the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return, and filing the final accounting.</p>
                <p>For families with assets in both counties, we coordinate the administration seamlessly to minimize delays and duplicated effort.</p>

                <h2>Estate Planning</h2>
                <p>Fox Chapel, Plum, and Penn Hills families span a wide range of estate planning needs — from young professionals buying their first home to established families with complex portfolios. We craft individualized plans using wills, revocable living trusts, irrevocable trusts, and powers of attorney, always with an eye toward minimizing Pennsylvania inheritance tax and avoiding unnecessary probate complexity.</p>

                <h2>Real Estate & Business Law</h2>
                <p>The eastern suburbs have an active real estate market, and our attorneys handle closings as licensed title insurance agents throughout Allegheny County. We also serve the area's business community with entity formation, contract review, and commercial lease negotiations.</p>
