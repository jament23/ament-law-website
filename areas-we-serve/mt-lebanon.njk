<h2>Legal Services for Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Mt. Lebanon is one of the largest and most sought-after communities in Pittsburgh's South Hills, home to over 33,000 residents and a nationally recognized school district. The community's mix of young families, established professionals, and retirees creates a wide range of legal needs — from first-time estate plans and home purchases to complex trust administration and business succession. Ament Law Group serves Mt. Lebanon clients across all of these areas from our Murrysville office.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Mt. Lebanon Families</h2>

<p>Mt. Lebanon families at every stage of life benefit from a properly drafted estate plan. For younger families, the priorities are typically guardian nominations for minor children, basic wills, and powers of attorney. For mid-career professionals, the plan expands to include beneficiary designation coordination across employer retirement plans, 401(k)s, and IRAs, as well as consideration of whether a revocable living trust makes sense to avoid probate on the family home.</p>

<p>For retirees and those approaching retirement, we focus on incapacity planning — making sure financial and healthcare powers of attorney are current and properly drafted under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601 — along with Pennsylvania inheritance tax minimization strategies and, where appropriate, Medicaid asset protection planning for families concerned about long-term care costs.</p>

<p>Regardless of where you are in life, every plan we build is coordinated — the will, the trust (if applicable), the powers of attorney, the beneficiary designations, and the property titles all work together as a single system.</p>

<h2>Probate & Trust Administration</h2>

<p>Mt. Lebanon estates are administered through the Allegheny County Register of Wills at the City-County Building. We handle the full process for executors and administrators: will filing, obtaining Short Certificates, publishing notice to creditors, preparing the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500), managing asset collection and transfers, and overseeing final distributions to beneficiaries. We also assist families with informal estate administration matters — retitling vehicles, closing bank accounts, and managing the practical details that follow a death.</p>

<h2>Real Estate</h2>

<p>Mt. Lebanon's active residential market — from the charming homes along Washington Road to newer construction throughout the township — generates steady demand for settlement services. As licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, we handle title searches, issue title insurance policies, prepare closing documents, and attend settlement. We record deeds with the Allegheny County Department of Real Estate and coordinate with lenders and real estate agents to keep closings on schedule.</p>

<p>For families transferring property to a trust, a child, or an LLC, we prepare the deed, analyze transfer tax exemptions under 72 P.S. § 8102-C, and handle the recording — making sure the transfer is properly coordinated with the overall estate plan.</p>

<h2>Business Law</h2>

<p>Mt. Lebanon's commercial district and the broader South Hills corridor are home to professional practices, retail businesses, and service companies. We assist business owners with LLC and corporation formation, operating agreements, commercial lease review, and buy-sell agreements. For business owners whose personal estate plan needs to account for the business — which is nearly always the case — we make sure the entity documents and the estate plan are built as a coordinated package.</p>
