                <h2>Serving Jeannette, Penn Township & Hempfield</h2>
                <p>The communities south and southwest of our Murrysville office — Jeannette, Penn Township, and Hempfield Township — represent some of Westmoreland County's most active areas for real estate, small business, and family estate planning. Ament Law Group provides experienced, personal counsel to residents throughout this part of the county.</p>

                <h2>Estate Planning & Probate</h2>
                <p>We work with Jeannette and Penn Township families to create estate plans that fit their specific needs, whether that's a straightforward will for a young family or a comprehensive trust-based plan for a more complex estate. When the time comes to administer an estate, we handle the probate process through the Westmoreland County Register of Wills from start to finish.</p>

                <h2>Real Estate</h2>
                <p>Hempfield Township and Penn Township see consistent real estate activity, from first-time buyers to downsizing retirees. As licensed title insurance agents, we handle residential closings, title searches, and title insurance throughout the area. We also assist with commercial real estate transactions and lease reviews for local businesses.</p>

                <h2>Business Law</h2>
                <p>From retail shops in downtown Jeannette to professional services along the Route 130 corridor, we help local business owners with entity formation, operating agreements, and ongoing legal needs.</p>
