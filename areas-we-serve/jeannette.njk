<h2>Legal Services for Jeannette, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Jeannette — the historic Glass City — has a proud legacy of industry and close-knit community that continues today. Located in southern Westmoreland County along Route 30, Jeannette residents benefit from Ament Law Group's comprehensive legal services in estate planning, probate, real estate, and business law. Our Murrysville office is a short drive north via Route 130, putting experienced legal counsel within easy reach for Jeannette families and businesses.</p>

<p>Jeannette's residential neighborhoods, local businesses along Clay Avenue and Route 30, and the surrounding Penn Township community create a variety of legal needs. Whether you are a homeowner updating your estate plan, an executor administering a loved one's estate through the Westmoreland County Register of Wills, or a small business owner who needs reliable contract review and legal guidance, our attorneys provide the same level of personal attention and legal expertise to every client.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning</h2>

<p>We prepare comprehensive estate plans for Jeannette families, including Last Wills and Testaments compliant with Pennsylvania's execution requirements (20 Pa.C.S. § 2502), durable financial powers of attorney (20 Pa.C.S. § 5601), advance healthcare directives, and revocable living trusts when they serve the client's goals. For Jeannette homeowners concerned about probate, we explain when a trust is genuinely beneficial versus when a properly drafted will and coordinated beneficiary designations accomplish the same result at lower cost — because we believe in recommending what is right for you, not what generates the highest fee.</p>

<h2>Probate and Estate Administration</h2>

<p>Westmoreland County probate matters are filed at the Register of Wills in the Greensburg courthouse. We guide Jeannette-area executors through the entire administration process: filing the will, obtaining Short Certificates, publishing creditor notices, inventorying and valuing assets, preparing the PA Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500), paying valid debts and taxes, and distributing the remaining assets to beneficiaries. We also advise executors on their fiduciary duties and the personal liability risks that come with the role, helping them avoid costly mistakes.</p>

<h2>Real Estate and Business Services</h2>

<p>As licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, we handle residential closings for Jeannette buyers and sellers — from title search through settlement and recording. Our business law practice serves Jeannette's entrepreneurs and established businesses with entity formation, operating agreements, contract drafting and review, and succession planning. We understand the challenges small business owners face and provide practical legal guidance tailored to the realities of running a business in Western Pennsylvania.</p>

<h2>Elder Law and Long-Term Care Planning</h2>

<p>Many Jeannette families face decisions about long-term care for aging parents. Nursing home costs in Westmoreland County can exceed $12,000 per month, making Medicaid planning an important part of protecting a family's financial security. We help families with both proactive planning — designing asset protection strategies well before care is needed — and crisis planning when a loved one requires immediate nursing facility placement. Pennsylvania's five-year Medicaid look-back period means the earlier you plan, the more options are available.</p>

<h2>Why Jeannette Residents Choose Ament Law Group</h2>

<p>Our Murrysville office is easily accessible from Jeannette via Route 130 North. We offer flexible scheduling, transparent billing with all fees agreed upon before work begins, and the kind of personal attention that larger firms cannot provide. Many of our Jeannette clients were referred by neighbors, family members, or other trusted advisors — and that reputation is something we work hard to maintain with every client we serve.</p>
