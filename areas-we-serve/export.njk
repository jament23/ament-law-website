<h2>Your Neighborhood Law Firm for Export, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Export and the surrounding Washington Township community sit just a few minutes north of our Murrysville office along Route 66. As one of the closest communities we serve, Export families and business owners can reach us quickly for estate planning, probate, real estate closings, and business law matters — all handled by attorneys who know Westmoreland County inside and out.</p>

<p>Whether you own a home along Old William Penn Highway, run a business in the Export commercial corridor, or are a long-time resident of Washington Township, Ament Law Group provides the legal services your family and business need. We have served this community for decades, and many of our Export clients are multi-generational — parents who planned their estates with us, and children who now turn to us for probate guidance, home purchases, and businesses of their own.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Export Families</h2>

<p>A proper estate plan ensures that your assets pass to the people you choose, in the manner you choose, with the least expense and delay. For Export residents, this typically means preparing a Last Will and Testament that complies with Pennsylvania's execution requirements under 20 Pa.C.S. § 2502, a durable financial power of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, and an advance healthcare directive. For families with more complex needs — such as blended families, business interests, or special needs beneficiaries — we design plans incorporating revocable living trusts, supplemental needs trusts, and coordinated beneficiary designations.</p>

<p>Without an estate plan, Pennsylvania's intestacy laws (20 Pa.C.S. § 2101 et seq.) determine who inherits your assets, and the result may not match your wishes. We help Export families take control of these decisions through careful, personalized planning.</p>

<h2>Probate and Estate Administration</h2>

<p>When a loved one passes, the executor or administrator must file with the Westmoreland County Register of Wills at the courthouse in Greensburg. We guide Export families through every step — from obtaining Letters Testamentary or Letters of Administration, to notifying creditors, inventorying assets, filing the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500), and making final distributions to beneficiaries. Our goal is to handle the legal complexity so you can focus on your family during a difficult time.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Services</h2>

<p>As licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, we handle residential real estate closings for Export buyers and sellers. Our services include title searches, title insurance issuance, settlement attendance, and deed recording with the Westmoreland County Recorder of Deeds. Whether you are purchasing your first home in Washington Township, selling a family property, or refinancing, we ensure a smooth, legally sound transaction.</p>

<h2>Business Law</h2>

<p>Export's small business community benefits from our full range of business legal services, including LLC and corporation formation with the Pennsylvania Department of State, operating agreement and bylaws drafting, contract review and negotiation, and business succession planning. We also serve as outside general counsel for businesses that need reliable legal guidance without the cost of a full-time in-house attorney.</p>

<h2>Why Export Residents Choose Ament Law Group</h2>

<p>Proximity matters when you need legal help. Our office at 3950 Wm Penn Highway in Murrysville is just a short drive from Export — close enough for in-person meetings, yet equipped with the technology to handle consultations remotely when that is more convenient. We offer flexible scheduling, including evening appointments for clients who cannot get away during the workday. Our fees are transparent — we provide flat-rate or hourly quotes upfront, negotiated before work begins, so you always know what to expect.</p>
