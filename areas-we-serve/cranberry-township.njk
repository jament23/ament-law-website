<h2>Legal Services for Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Cranberry Township in Butler County is one of the fastest-growing communities in the greater Pittsburgh region, with a thriving mix of corporate offices, retail centers, and family-oriented neighborhoods. Ament Law Group serves Cranberry Township residents and businesses with estate planning, probate, real estate closings, and business law. While our office is located in Murrysville, many Cranberry Township clients appreciate our combination of deep Western Pennsylvania legal knowledge and the personal attention that larger suburban firms often cannot provide.</p>

<p>Cranberry Township's rapid growth means that families are buying homes, starting businesses, and building wealth at a pace that demands reliable legal counsel. From young professionals in Cranberry's newer developments to established families and business owners along Route 19, our attorneys help Cranberry residents protect their families, their property, and their businesses.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning</h2>

<p>We prepare comprehensive estate plans for Cranberry Township families, including wills compliant with 20 Pa.C.S. § 2502, durable powers of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, advance healthcare directives, and revocable living trusts. For Cranberry's many dual-income professional families, we address coordination of employer-provided life insurance, retirement account beneficiary designations, and the interplay between jointly owned property and individual estate plans. We also help Cranberry residents who have relocated from other states update their estate plans to comply with Pennsylvania law — a will valid in another state may not take full advantage of Pennsylvania's planning opportunities.</p>

<h2>Probate and Estate Administration</h2>

<p>Cranberry Township estates are administered through the Butler County Register of Wills in the Butler courthouse — a different jurisdiction than many of the Westmoreland County estates we handle, but one we are equally experienced in navigating. We guide executors and administrators through will filing, Short Certificate issuance, creditor notification, asset inventory, PA Inheritance Tax Return preparation (REV-1500), and final distribution. For Cranberry families, we make the process as smooth and efficient as possible, handling the legal details so you can focus on your family.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Closings</h2>

<p>Cranberry Township's active real estate market — from homes in developments like Cranberry Highlands and Graham Park to new construction throughout the township — benefits from our full settlement services. As licensed title agents through Chicago Title and First American, we conduct title searches, issue title insurance policies, prepare closing documents, and attend settlement. We represent buyers, sellers, and refinancing clients in Butler County and coordinate with lenders and agents to ensure timely closings.</p>

<h2>Business Law</h2>

<p>Cranberry Township's Route 19 corridor is home to corporate offices, medical practices, technology firms, and retail businesses that need reliable legal support. We help Cranberry business owners with entity formation, operating agreements, contract review, commercial lease negotiations, and business succession planning. For growing businesses, we serve as outside general counsel — providing the strategic legal guidance of an in-house attorney at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<h2>Serving Butler County from Westmoreland County</h2>

<p>While our office is in Murrysville, we regularly serve clients in Butler County and Cranberry Township. We handle filings with the Butler County courts, Recorder of Deeds, and Register of Wills with the same familiarity we bring to Westmoreland County matters. We also offer remote consultations for Cranberry clients when visiting our office is not convenient, and our transparent billing — with fees agreed upon before work begins — gives you confidence regardless of where we meet.</p>
