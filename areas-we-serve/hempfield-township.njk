<h2>Legal Services for Hempfield Township, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Hempfield Township is one of the largest municipalities in Westmoreland County, stretching from the outskirts of Greensburg south and west toward the Westmoreland Mall corridor and the communities of Adamsburg, Bovard, and Carbon. With a population of nearly 40,000 residents, established neighborhoods, a growing commercial base along Route 30, and strong school districts, Hempfield is home to families and businesses with diverse legal needs. Ament Law Group serves Hempfield Township clients from our Murrysville office, a short drive north along Route 136 or Route 30.</p>

<p>As a Westmoreland County firm, we handle matters at the Westmoreland County Courthouse in Greensburg regularly — the same courthouse that serves Hempfield Township residents. This proximity means we know the local procedures, the staff at the Register of Wills, and the requirements specific to Westmoreland County filings.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Hempfield Families</h2>

<p>We create customized estate plans for Hempfield Township residents that include wills, durable powers of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, healthcare directives, and revocable living trusts when they serve the client's goals. Many Hempfield families include professionals working in the Greensburg area, retirees with multiple accounts and real estate holdings, and business owners along the Route 30 corridor — all situations that benefit from a coordinated plan that addresses every asset and every contingency.</p>

<h2>Probate and Estate Administration</h2>

<p>Hempfield Township estates are administered through the Westmoreland County Register of Wills at the courthouse in Greensburg. We guide executors and administrators through the full process — filing the will, obtaining Short Certificates, notifying creditors, inventorying assets, preparing the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500) within nine months to capture the 5% discount for timely filing, and making final distributions to beneficiaries. We handle straightforward estates and complex ones alike, including estates with real property in multiple counties.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Closings</h2>

<p>Hempfield Township's active real estate market — from established neighborhoods near Greensburg-Salem to newer developments along the Route 30 corridor — benefits from our full settlement services. As licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, we handle title searches, issue title insurance policies, prepare closing documents, and attend settlement. We also assist with deed transfers to trusts, LLCs, and family members, ensuring proper transfer tax treatment under Pennsylvania law.</p>

<h2>Business Law</h2>

<p>Hempfield Township's business community includes professional offices, medical practices, retail establishments along Route 30, and a wide range of family-owned businesses. We help Hempfield business owners with LLC and corporation formation, operating agreements, contract review, commercial lease negotiations, and succession planning. For business owners whose estate plan and business structure need to work together — which is nearly always the case — we handle both under one roof.</p>

<h2>Why Hempfield Residents Choose Ament Law Group</h2>
