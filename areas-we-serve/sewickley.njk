<h2>Legal Services for Sewickley, Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>Sewickley and the surrounding Quaker Valley communities — Sewickley Heights, Edgeworth, Leet, and Leetsdale — form one of Western Pennsylvania's most established and affluent residential areas. Families here often have substantial estates, multiple properties, business interests, and multi-generational wealth that requires coordinated legal planning across estate, real estate, and business law. Ament Law Group serves Sewickley-area clients from our Murrysville office, providing the kind of personalized, integrated counsel that larger firms charge significantly more to deliver.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Sewickley Families</h2>

<p>Sewickley families frequently need estate plans that address high-value real estate (often including the family home, vacation properties, and investment real estate), concentrated stock positions, business ownership interests, and charitable giving goals. We draft comprehensive plans that may include revocable living trusts, irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILITs), charitable remainder trusts, special needs trusts for family members with disabilities, and generation-skipping provisions to protect wealth across multiple generations.</p>

<p>We pay particular attention to Pennsylvania inheritance tax planning — at a 4.5% rate on transfers to lineal descendants, even a moderately sized estate can generate a meaningful tax bill. We use lawful strategies including inter vivos gifts, life insurance structuring, and trust design to minimize the impact on the family.</p>

<p>Every plan includes properly drafted powers of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601 and healthcare directives — documents that are critical for families with complex financial lives where incapacity planning can be just as important as death planning.</p>

<h2>Probate & Trust Administration</h2>

<p>Sewickley estates are administered through the Allegheny County Register of Wills. We handle every step: filing the will, obtaining Short Certificates, notifying creditors and beneficiaries, preparing the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500), managing asset collection and retitling, and overseeing final distributions. For estates above the federal estate tax threshold, we coordinate with the family's CPA on the federal return (Form 706) and advise on portability elections, valuation discounts, and other strategies that can significantly reduce the combined tax burden.</p>

<h2>Real Estate</h2>

<p>Sewickley's real estate market ranges from historic village homes to large estates in Sewickley Heights, with property values that make title work and transfer tax planning particularly important. We handle residential closings, title searches, and title insurance as licensed agents through Chicago Title and First American. For families transferring real estate to trusts, children, or LLCs, we analyze the transfer tax implications under 72 P.S. § 8102-C and structure the transaction to qualify for available exemptions.</p>

<h2>Business Law</h2>

<p>Many Sewickley residents own businesses, medical practices, or professional firms. We handle formation, operating agreements, corporate governance, and buy-sell agreements. For business owners, estate planning and business planning are inseparable — we make sure the entity documents, succession plan, and estate plan all work together so the family and the business are protected.</p>
