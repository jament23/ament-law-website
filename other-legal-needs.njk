        <h1>Need a Different Type of Attorney?</h1>
        <p>Our firm focuses on estate planning, probate, real estate, and business law. If you need help with something outside our practice areas, we will connect you with a trusted local attorney who handles your type of case.</p>

        <h2>Practice Areas We Do Not Handle</h2>
        <p>While our attorneys have broad legal backgrounds, Ament Law Group limits its active practice to estate planning, probate and trust administration, real estate, elder law, and business law. We do not accept cases in the following areas — but we regularly connect clients and community members with experienced attorneys who do.</p>

        <div class="referral-grid">
            <div class="referral-card">
                <h3>Personal Injury</h3>
                <p>If you have been injured in a car accident, slip-and-fall, or other incident caused by someone else's negligence, you may have a personal injury claim. Pennsylvania law generally gives you two years from the date of injury to file a lawsuit under 42 Pa.C.S. § 5524. Time limits matter — if you have been hurt, speak with a personal injury attorney promptly. Most personal injury attorneys offer free consultations and work on a contingency fee basis, meaning you pay nothing unless you recover compensation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="referral-card">
                <h3>Medical Malpractice</h3>
                <p>Medical malpractice occurs when a healthcare provider's treatment falls below the accepted standard of care and causes harm. In Pennsylvania, these claims require a Certificate of Merit from a qualified medical expert under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1042.3, which must be filed within 60 days of the complaint. These cases are complex and require attorneys with specific experience in medical litigation. If you believe you or a family member received substandard medical care, we can point you to an attorney equipped to evaluate your claim.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="referral-card">
                <h3>Workers' Compensation</h3>
                <p>If you were injured on the job, Pennsylvania's Workers' Compensation Act (77 P.S. § 1 et seq.) provides wage loss benefits and medical coverage regardless of fault. You must report your injury to your employer within 120 days, and claims must generally be filed within three years. Workers' compensation has its own administrative system and procedures separate from the regular court system. An experienced workers' compensation attorney can ensure you receive the benefits you are entitled to.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="referral-card">
                <h3>Social Security Disability</h3>
                <p>If a medical condition prevents you from working, you may qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The application process is lengthy, and most initial claims are denied. An attorney who handles Social Security disability cases can help you navigate the appeals process, prepare for hearings before an Administrative Law Judge, and gather the medical evidence needed to support your claim.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="referral-card">
                <h3>Criminal Defense</h3>
                <p>If you are facing criminal charges in Pennsylvania — whether a summary offense, misdemeanor, or felony — you have the right to legal representation. Criminal cases move quickly, and early involvement of an attorney can make a significant difference in the outcome. We do not handle criminal matters, but we can help you find a criminal defense attorney in Westmoreland County or the surrounding area.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="referral-card">
                <h3>Family Law &amp; Divorce</h3>
                <p>Divorce, child custody, child support, and protection from abuse cases fall under Pennsylvania's family law system. These cases are handled in the Family Division of the Court of Common Pleas and involve their own procedures, timelines, and considerations. If you are going through a separation, custody dispute, or other family law matter, we can connect you with a family law attorney who practices in your county.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="referral-card">
                <h3>Bankruptcy</h3>
                <p>If you are overwhelmed by debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy may provide relief. Bankruptcy is handled in federal court — in Western Pennsylvania, that is the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The process involves means testing, creditor negotiations, and court hearings that require an attorney experienced in bankruptcy law. We can refer you to a bankruptcy attorney who can evaluate your options.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="referral-card">
                <h3>Immigration</h3>
                <p>Immigration matters — including visas, green cards, naturalization, asylum, and deportation defense — are governed by federal law and handled through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the immigration court system. These cases require an attorney with immigration-specific knowledge. If you need immigration assistance, we can help you find a qualified immigration attorney in Western Pennsylvania.</p>

        <h2>Why We Refer Instead of Taking Every Case</h2>
        <p>Some firms try to handle everything. We believe you deserve an attorney who focuses on the type of case you have — not one who dabbles in a dozen practice areas. When your matter falls outside our core areas, the most helpful thing we can do is connect you with someone who handles that type of case every day. That is not a limitation. It is how we ensure every person who contacts us gets the best possible help.</p>

        <h2>How Our Referral Process Works</h2>
        <p>Call us at <a href="tel:724-733-3500">(724) 733-3500</a> or <a href="/contact/">contact us online</a> and let us know what you are dealing with. We will listen, help you understand what type of attorney you need, and connect you with a trusted local attorney who handles that type of case. There is no charge for this — we are happy to point you in the right direction.</p>
        <p>If your situation also involves estate planning, probate, real estate, or business law, we can handle that piece directly while coordinating with the other attorney on the rest.</p>
