        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What legal services does Ament Law Group offer?</h3>
            <p>We provide comprehensive legal services in estate planning and administration (drafting wills, trusts, powers of attorney, and guiding clients through probate and trust administration), real estate transactions (property purchases and sales, lease agreements, landlord-tenant issues, assessment appeals, and settlement services), and business law (business formation, contract drafting and review, compliance, dispute resolution, and general counsel services for small businesses).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need a will or a trust?</h3>
            <p>It depends on your circumstances. A will directs how your assets are distributed and names a guardian for minor children, but it goes through probate. A trust can help you avoid probate, provide privacy, and maintain control over how and when beneficiaries receive assets. During your consultation, we'll help you determine which approach—or combination—best fits your situation and goals.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is probate, and can I avoid it?</h3>
            <p>Probate is the legal process of administering a deceased person's estate through the Register of Wills. In Pennsylvania, probate involves validating the will, paying debts and taxes, and distributing assets. While probate cannot always be completely avoided, there are strategies to minimize its scope and cost, including revocable living trusts, joint ownership, and beneficiary designations. We can help you plan accordingly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is a "Short Certificate" and how do I get one?</h3>
            <p>A Short Certificate is a legal document issued by the Register of Wills that certifies the appointment of an executor (if there is a will) or an administrator (if there is no will) of an estate. Banks and financial institutions typically require a Short Certificate before they will allow you to access or manage a deceased person's accounts. Obtaining one requires filing a petition with the Register of Wills in the appropriate county. Our attorneys can guide you through the entire process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How much does probate cost in Pennsylvania?</h3>
            <p>Probate costs vary based on estate size and complexity. Common expenses include Register of Wills filing fees ($200–$500+), attorney's fees (typically 2–5% of estate value or hourly), executor compensation, appraisal costs, and tax preparation fees. Read our <a href="/blog/how-to-minimize-probate-costs-in-pennsylvania/">guide to minimizing probate costs</a> for detailed strategies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What should I bring to my first estate planning meeting?</h3>
            <p>It's helpful to bring a list of your assets and their approximate values (real estate, bank accounts, retirement accounts, life insurance), information about your debts, the names and contact information for people you'd like to name as executors, trustees, guardians, or agents, and any existing estate planning documents you may have (prior wills, trusts, powers of attorney).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you handle real estate closings?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Our attorneys are licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American. We handle residential and commercial closings, title examinations, and title insurance, ensuring our clients have peace of mind when purchasing or selling property.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can you help me form a business?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. We guide clients through selecting the right business structure (LLC, corporation, partnership), filing formation documents with the Pennsylvania Department of State, drafting operating agreements or bylaws, and handling initial compliance requirements. We also assist with ongoing business legal needs including contract drafting, dispute resolution, and succession planning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is Medicaid planning, and when should I start?</h3>
            <p>Medicaid planning involves developing strategies to protect your assets while qualifying for Medicaid to cover long-term care costs. Pennsylvania has a five-year look-back period, meaning asset transfers made within five years of applying may result in penalties. The earlier you begin planning, the more options are available. We recommend discussing Medicaid planning well before any anticipated need for nursing home care.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: var(--space-xl);">Estate Planning & Probate</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I avoid probate in Pennsylvania?</h3>
            <p>Several strategies can help minimize or avoid probate. Holding assets in joint tenancy with right of survivorship allows them to pass automatically to the surviving owner. Naming beneficiaries on retirement accounts and life insurance keeps those assets out of probate entirely. Payable-on-death (POD) and transfer-on-death (TOD) designations on bank and investment accounts work similarly. A revocable living trust can hold other assets outside probate. The right combination depends on your assets, family situation, and goals — which is why we tailor every plan to the individual client rather than offering a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens if you die without a will in Pennsylvania?</h3>
            <p>Pennsylvania's intestacy statute (20 Pa.C.S. Chapter 21) determines who inherits when there is no valid will. If you are married with no children, your spouse inherits everything. If you have a surviving spouse and children who are also your spouse's children, your spouse receives the first $30,000 plus half of the remaining balance, and the children share the rest equally. Without a spouse, children inherit in equal shares. Without a spouse or children, parents inherit. Without parents, siblings inherit. These default rules rarely match what most people would choose — which is why having a will is so important.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How much does Pennsylvania inheritance tax cost?</h3>
            <p>Pennsylvania imposes an inheritance tax based on the relationship between the deceased person and the beneficiary. The rates are: 0% for transfers to a surviving spouse, 4.5% for transfers to lineal descendants (children, grandchildren) and lineal ancestors (parents), 12% for transfers to siblings, and 15% for transfers to all other beneficiaries including nieces, nephews, friends, and unmarried partners. Life insurance proceeds paid to a named beneficiary are exempt from Pennsylvania inheritance tax. There are also exemptions for certain farmland and family-owned businesses. Our <a href="/resources/">free PA Inheritance Tax Guide</a> covers this in detail.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is a power of attorney and do I need one?</h3>
            <p>A power of attorney is a legal document that authorizes someone you trust (your "agent") to act on your behalf. A financial power of attorney covers decisions about your money, property, and financial affairs. A healthcare power of attorney (or healthcare directive) covers medical decisions if you cannot make them yourself. Every adult over 18 should have both documents in place. Without them, your family may need to petition the court for guardianship if you become incapacitated — a process that is expensive, time-consuming, and public. A properly drafted power of attorney avoids that entirely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I transfer a house after someone dies in Pennsylvania?</h3>
            <p>The process depends on how the property was titled. If the property was held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, it passes automatically to the surviving owner — you will need a death certificate and typically an affidavit of survivorship recorded with the county recorder of deeds. If the property was held solely by the deceased, it must pass through probate. The executor or administrator transfers the property by executor's deed after the estate is opened with the Register of Wills. If the property was held in a revocable living trust, the successor trustee handles the transfer by trustee's deed without going through probate.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 style="margin-top: var(--space-xl);">Real Estate & Business</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need a lawyer for a real estate closing in PA?</h3>
            <p>Pennsylvania does not legally require an attorney at closing, but having one provides significant protection. An attorney reviews the agreement of sale for issues, conducts or reviews the title search for liens and encumbrances, explains the legal implications of every document you sign, identifies potential problems before you get to the settlement table, and ensures the transaction is recorded properly with the county. For most people, buying or selling a home is the largest financial transaction of their life — attorney representation is a wise investment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is the difference between an LLC and a corporation in Pennsylvania?</h3>
            <p>Both LLCs and corporations provide personal liability protection, but they differ in structure, taxation, and formality requirements. An LLC offers flexible management (member-managed or manager-managed), pass-through taxation by default, and fewer ongoing formality requirements. A corporation has a more rigid governance structure with officers, directors, and shareholders, and may be subject to double taxation at the corporate and individual level — unless it elects S-corporation status. LLCs are generally better suited for small businesses and real estate holdings, while corporations may be advantageous for businesses seeking outside investment or planning to go public. We help clients choose the right structure based on their specific goals and tax situation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 style="margin-top: var(--space-xl);">Other Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does Ament Law Group handle personal injury or criminal cases?</h3>
            <p>No. Our firm focuses on estate planning, probate, real estate, elder law, and business law. We do not handle personal injury, medical malpractice, workers' compensation, criminal defense, family law, bankruptcy, or immigration matters.
