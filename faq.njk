        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What legal services does Ament Law Group offer?</h3>
            <p>We provide comprehensive legal services in estate planning and administration (drafting wills, trusts, powers of attorney, and guiding clients through probate and trust administration), real estate transactions (property purchases and sales, lease agreements, landlord-tenant issues, assessment appeals, and settlement services), and business law (business formation, contract drafting and review, compliance, dispute resolution, and general counsel services for small businesses).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need a will or a trust?</h3>
            <p>It depends on your circumstances. A will directs how your assets are distributed and names a guardian for minor children, but it goes through probate. A trust can help you avoid probate, provide privacy, and maintain control over how and when beneficiaries receive assets. During your consultation, we'll help you determine which approach—or combination—best fits your situation and goals.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is probate, and can I avoid it?</h3>
            <p>Probate is the legal process of administering a deceased person's estate through the Register of Wills. In Pennsylvania, probate involves validating the will, paying debts and taxes, and distributing assets. While probate cannot always be completely avoided, there are strategies to minimize its scope and cost, including revocable living trusts, joint ownership, and beneficiary designations. We can help you plan accordingly.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is a "Short Certificate" and how do I get one?</h3>
            <p>A Short Certificate is a legal document issued by the Register of Wills that certifies the appointment of an executor (if there is a will) or an administrator (if there is no will) of an estate. Banks and financial institutions typically require a Short Certificate before they will allow you to access or manage a deceased person's accounts. Obtaining one requires filing a petition with the Register of Wills in the appropriate county. Our attorneys can guide you through the entire process.</p>

            <h3>How much does probate cost in Pennsylvania?</h3>
            <p>Probate costs vary based on estate size and complexity. Common expenses include Register of Wills filing fees ($200–$500+), attorney's fees (typically 2–5% of estate value or hourly), executor compensation, appraisal costs, and tax preparation fees.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What should I bring to my first estate planning meeting?</h3>
            <p>It's helpful to bring a list of your assets and their approximate values (real estate, bank accounts, retirement accounts, life insurance), information about your debts, the names and contact information for people you'd like to name as executors, trustees, guardians, or agents, and any existing estate planning documents you may have (prior wills, trusts, powers of attorney).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you handle real estate closings?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Our attorneys are licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American. We handle residential and commercial closings, title examinations, and title insurance, ensuring our clients have peace of mind when purchasing or selling property.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can you help me form a business?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. We guide clients through selecting the right business structure (LLC, corporation, partnership), filing formation documents with the Pennsylvania Department of State, drafting operating agreements or bylaws, and handling initial compliance requirements. We also assist with ongoing business legal needs including contract drafting, dispute resolution, and succession planning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is Medicaid planning, and when should I start?</h3>
            <p>Medicaid planning involves developing strategies to protect your assets while qualifying for Medicaid to cover long-term care costs. Pennsylvania has a five-year look-back period, meaning asset transfers made within five years of applying may result in penalties. The earlier you begin planning, the more options are available. We recommend discussing Medicaid planning well before any anticipated need for nursing home care.</p>
