Being named as executor of someone's estate is a meaningful honor — it means the decedent trusted you to carry out their final wishes. But it is also a serious legal responsibility with real financial consequences if mistakes are made. In Pennsylvania, an executor (also called a personal representative) is a fiduciary, and fiduciaries can be held personally liable for losses caused by their negligence, mismanagement, or breach of duty.

Understanding your obligations before you begin administering the estate is the best way to protect yourself and the beneficiaries.

## What Are an Executor's Fiduciary Duties?

As executor, you owe fiduciary duties to the estate and its beneficiaries. These duties are established by Pennsylvania's Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code (20 Pa.C.S. § 101 et seq.) and include the duty of loyalty, meaning you must act in the best interests of the estate and its beneficiaries, not in your own self-interest. You also owe the duty of care, meaning you must manage estate assets prudently, the same way a reasonable person would handle their own affairs. Additionally, you owe the duty of impartiality, meaning you must treat all beneficiaries fairly and not favor one over another unless the will specifically directs otherwise.

## Where Executors Get Into Trouble

### Premature Distributions

One of the most common and costly mistakes executors make is distributing assets to beneficiaries before all debts, taxes, and claims have been paid. Under Pennsylvania law, creditors have one year from the date of the estate notice publication to file claims against the estate. If you distribute assets before this period expires and a creditor later comes forward with a valid claim, you are personally liable for the amount distributed.

This does not mean you must wait a full year before making any distributions. With proper guidance, interim distributions can be made while retaining sufficient reserves for known and potential claims. But the risk of premature distribution is real, and executors who act too quickly can find themselves writing personal checks to satisfy estate debts.

### Failing to File or Pay Taxes

Executors are responsible for filing the decedent's final income tax returns, the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500), and any estate income tax returns. Failure to file these returns or to pay the taxes owed can result in penalties, interest, and personal liability for the executor.

The inheritance tax return is due within nine months of the date of death. A 5% discount is available if the tax is paid within three months. Missing the nine-month deadline triggers interest charges at 6% per year, calculated from nine months after the date of death. These deadlines are firm, and the Department of Revenue does not routinely grant extensions.

### Mismanagement of Estate Assets

During the administration of the estate, the executor has a duty to safeguard and preserve estate assets. This includes maintaining insurance on real property, securing valuable personal property, investing estate funds prudently, and keeping estate funds separate from personal funds. Commingling estate and personal funds is a serious breach of fiduciary duty and can result in surcharge — a court-ordered requirement that the executor personally reimburse the estate for any losses.

### Self-Dealing

An executor may not use estate assets for personal benefit, purchase estate property at a discount, or engage in transactions that benefit themselves at the expense of the estate. Even transactions that appear fair can be challenged if they involve a conflict of interest. When an executor is also a beneficiary of the estate — which is common — it is especially important to document every decision and transaction to demonstrate that all actions were taken in the estate's best interest.

## How to Protect Yourself as Executor

### Hire an Attorney

The single best thing an executor can do to protect themselves is to retain an experienced probate attorney. An attorney guides you through every step of the process, helps you avoid common pitfalls, ensures that all legal requirements are met, and provides documentation that demonstrates you acted prudently and in good faith. Attorney fees for estate administration are a legitimate estate expense — not a personal cost to the executor.

### Keep Detailed Records

Document everything. Maintain a log of all estate transactions, keep copies of all correspondence, save receipts for every expense paid from estate funds, and retain records of all distributions with signed receipts from beneficiaries. If your administration is ever challenged, thorough documentation is your best defense.

### Obtain Receipts and Releases

Before making any distribution, obtain a signed receipt and release from each beneficiary acknowledging the amount received and releasing the executor from further liability related to that distribution. Alternatively, you can file a formal accounting with the Orphans' Court and obtain court approval of your administration. A court-approved accounting provides the strongest protection against future claims.

### File a Family Settlement Agreement

In many cases, beneficiaries can agree to a Family Settlement Agreement (FSA) — a binding agreement among all parties that approves the executor's accounting and authorizes final distributions. An FSA avoids the need for formal court proceedings and typically costs approximately $75 to file with the Register of Wills. This is often the most efficient way to close an estate and protect the executor.

## Can You Decline to Serve?

Yes. Being named as executor in someone's will does not obligate you to serve. If you do not want to take on the responsibility, you can renounce your appointment by filing a renunciation with the Register of Wills. The will typically names a successor executor; if not, the court will appoint someone. There is no penalty for declining, and it is better to renounce than to accept a role you are unable or unwilling to fulfill properly.

## Executor Compensation

Pennsylvania law entitles executors to reasonable compensation for their services. While there is no fixed statutory fee schedule, compensation is typically based on the size and complexity of the estate, the time and effort required, and the degree of responsibility involved. Courts have approved compensation ranging from approximately 3% to 5% of the estate's value for routine administrations, though complex estates may warrant higher fees. Compensation is taxable income to the executor.
