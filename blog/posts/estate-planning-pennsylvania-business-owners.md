<div class="quick-answer">
<p>If you own a business in Pennsylvania, your estate plan has layers that a standard will and power of attorney do not address. The business itself — its value, its continuity, and how your interest in it will be handled at your death — needs to be part of your plan. Without proper planning, your business can become a source of conflict for your heirs, a forced sale at a distressed price, or a trigger for a tax liability your estate cannot pay. Here is what to think about.</p>

## The Business Is Probably Your Largest Asset

For most small business owners, the business represents the majority of their net worth. A thriving law firm, construction company, retail business, or professional practice may be worth far more than the owner's home, retirement accounts, and other assets combined.

This creates a fundamental estate planning challenge: the business is illiquid. You cannot easily divide it among multiple heirs, and you cannot write a check from it to pay an estate tax bill without either borrowing against it or selling it. A well-designed estate plan addresses these issues before they become a crisis.

## Business Valuation: What Is Your Business Actually Worth?

One of the first questions any business owner needs to answer is: what is my business worth? This matters for several reasons:

**Pennsylvania inheritance tax:** Your business interest — whether an LLC membership, corporate stock, or partnership interest — is a taxable asset for Pennsylvania inheritance tax purposes. The value reported on the inheritance tax return is subject to scrutiny, and an unsupported valuation can be challenged by the Department of Revenue.

**Buy-sell agreements:** If your business has co-owners, the buy-sell agreement needs a clear valuation methodology to be enforceable. A formula that made sense five years ago may significantly overvalue or undervalue the business today.

**Gift planning:** If you want to transfer business interests to family members over time, you need to know the value in order to stay within annual gift exclusion limits and use your lifetime exemption strategically.

For most small businesses, a formal business valuation by a qualified appraiser is worth the investment — both for planning purposes and to support the values reported on gift and estate tax returns.

## Buy-Sell Agreements: The Cornerstone of Business Succession

If you co-own a business with one or more partners, a buy-sell agreement is not optional — it is essential. A buy-sell agreement governs what happens to a business owner's interest when they die, become disabled, want to retire, or are otherwise unable to continue participating in the business.

Without a buy-sell agreement, the death of a co-owner can leave you in business with their surviving spouse or children — people who may have no involvement in or understanding of the business, but who now own an interest in it. This is almost never what either party wants.

**Key elements of a well-drafted buy-sell agreement:**

*Triggering events:* What events activate the buyout obligation? Death and permanent disability are standard. Most agreements also address voluntary departure, termination for cause, divorce, and bankruptcy.

*Valuation:* How is the purchase price determined? Options include a fixed price (which requires regular updates), a formula based on earnings or revenue, or third-party appraisal. Each approach has trade-offs.

*Funding mechanism:* How will the buyout be paid? Life insurance is the most common funding mechanism for the death trigger — the business or the surviving owners purchase life insurance on each owner's life, and the proceeds are used to fund the buyout when an owner dies.

*Payment terms:* Is the buyout paid in a lump sum, or in installments? Installment payments may be necessary if the business does not have sufficient liquidity for a lump-sum payment.

## Succession Planning: Who Runs the Business After You?

Succession planning is distinct from the buy-sell agreement. The buy-sell addresses who owns the business after you are gone — succession planning addresses who runs it.

If your intention is for the business to continue under family ownership, identify and develop a successor early. A business that depends entirely on the owner's relationships, expertise, and daily involvement does not have a succession plan — it has a closure plan.

Key questions to address in your succession plan:

- Who has the skills and relationships to lead the business?
- Is that person ready now, or do they need several years of preparation?
- How will you transition client relationships, institutional knowledge, and operational authority?
- If the business will be sold rather than transferred to family, what steps will maximize its value and marketability?

## Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax and Your Business

Pennsylvania inheritance tax applies to the value of business interests transferred at death, with no exemption for family-owned businesses. At 4.5% for transfers to children — and 15% for transfers to other beneficiaries — the tax on a $2 million business interest can easily exceed $90,000 to $300,000.

There are planning strategies that can reduce this exposure:

**Annual gifting:** The $19,000 annual gift exclusion can be used to transfer business interests to family members each year, reducing the taxable estate over time. With proper planning and minority interest discounts, the effective transfer can be significantly larger than the exclusion amount suggests.

**Irrevocable trusts:** Certain trust structures can remove business interests from your taxable estate while providing income or other benefits during your lifetime.

**Life insurance:** A life insurance policy owned outside your estate (typically in an irrevocable life insurance trust) can provide liquidity to pay inheritance tax without requiring a forced sale of the business.

## The Interaction Between Your Personal Estate Plan and Your Business Documents

One of the most common problems we see is a disconnect between a business owner's personal estate plan and their business documents. For example:

- A will that leaves a business interest to children equally, but a buy-sell agreement that requires the interest to be sold back to the company at death — creating a conflict
- A power of attorney that does not explicitly authorize the agent to act on behalf of the business, leaving a gap if the owner becomes incapacitated
- An operating agreement that treats a deceased member's estate as a mere economic interest holder — not a voting member — creating governance problems

These conflicts are avoidable. The solution is to have the same attorney review both your personal estate plan and your business documents together, as a coordinated set.
