Estate administration is a complex legal process that involves managing and distributing a deceased person's assets. In Pennsylvania, this process can be daunting for executors and beneficiaries alike. An experienced estate attorney is invaluable.

## What Is Estate Administration?

Estate administration refers to the legal process of settling a deceased person's estate. This includes identifying and valuing assets, paying debts and taxes, and distributing remaining property to heirs or beneficiaries. In Pennsylvania, the Orphans' Court oversees this process, and compliance with state probate laws is essential.

## What Estate Attorneys Do

Estate attorneys perform a wide range of tasks, including filing the petition for probate, advising the executor or administrator, preparing and filing tax returns, communicating with beneficiaries, resolving disputes and claims, and ensuring compliance with Pennsylvania probate law.

## Navigating Probate

Probate begins with filing a petition with the Register of Wills. An attorney helps prepare the necessary documents, represent the estate in court, and ensure all deadlines and legal requirements are met.

## When There Is No Will

When someone dies without a will, their estate is considered intestate. Pennsylvania law dictates how assets are distributed in these cases. An estate attorney helps navigate the intestacy laws, identify rightful heirs, and manage the administration.

## Protecting Executors

Executors have a legal duty to act in the best interest of the estate and its beneficiaries. Mistakes or mismanagement can lead to personal liability. Attorneys provide essential guidance to protect executors from legal risks.

## Choosing the Right Attorney

Look for professionals with expertise in Pennsylvania probate law, strong communication skills, and a commitment to client service. The attorneys at Ament Law Group offer personalized guidance and support throughout the estate administration process.
