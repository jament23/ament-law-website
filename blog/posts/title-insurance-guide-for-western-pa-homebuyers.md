Buying a home in Western Pennsylvania — whether in Murrysville, Greensburg, Monroeville, or anywhere in Westmoreland or Allegheny County — is one of the biggest financial commitments you will make. Title insurance is a critical part of protecting that investment, yet many buyers go through the closing process without fully understanding what it is, why they need it, or what it actually covers.

Here are five things every Western PA homebuyer should know before they sit down at the settlement table.

## 1. Title Insurance Protects You from Problems That Happened Before You Bought the House

Unlike homeowner's insurance, which protects against future events like fire or theft, title insurance protects you against defects in the chain of ownership that already exist at the time you purchase the property. These defects include things like unpaid liens from prior owners, forged signatures on a prior deed, undisclosed heirs who have a legal claim to the property, errors in the legal description or survey, and unreleased mortgages that were paid off but never properly recorded.

In Western Pennsylvania, where many properties have long and complex ownership histories, these issues come up more often than you might expect. A title search examines public records to identify known problems before closing, but title insurance provides a safety net for issues the search cannot uncover.

## 2. There Are Two Types — and You Need Both

Your mortgage lender will require a lender's title insurance policy to protect their interest in the property. This policy protects the lender, not you. An owner's title insurance policy protects your equity in the property and is optional but highly recommended.

The owner's policy is a one-time premium paid at closing that protects you for as long as you own the home — or even after you sell, if a covered claim arises from the period of your ownership. In Pennsylvania, the cost of an owner's policy is modest relative to the purchase price, and simultaneous issuance with a lender's policy typically qualifies for a discounted rate.

## 3. Not All Title Companies Are the Same

In Pennsylvania, title insurance can be issued by a title company, a title insurance agent, or an attorney who is also a licensed title agent. At Ament Law Group, our attorneys are licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, which means you get both the legal expertise of an attorney reviewing your transaction and the protection of title insurance from nationally recognized underwriters.

The difference matters. A title company employee may process your closing efficiently, but they are not in a position to identify legal issues in the agreement of sale, advise you on the implications of title exceptions, or represent your interests if a dispute arises. An attorney who is also a title agent brings both capabilities to the table.

## 4. Common Title Issues in Westmoreland and Allegheny Counties

Western Pennsylvania's long history means that title searches frequently uncover issues specific to this region. Properties that have been in the same family for generations may have unclear chains of title, estates that were never properly probated, or deed descriptions that reference landmarks that no longer exist. Older neighborhoods in Greensburg, Irwin, and Jeannette often present issues with unreleased liens, boundary discrepancies, and easements that were never formally recorded.

Our attorneys encounter and resolve these issues regularly. When we identify a title defect during the search, we work to clear it before closing — through lien payoffs, corrective deeds, affidavits, or quiet title actions — so that you receive clear title to your property.

## 5. Your Title Insurance Premium Is Regulated

Pennsylvania regulates title insurance rates, which means the premium is the same regardless of which title company or agent you use. This means your decision should be based on the quality of the title search, the expertise of the person reviewing your transaction, and the level of service you receive — not on price shopping for the lowest premium.

When you work with Ament Law Group for your [real estate settlement](/practice-areas/real-estate-law/), your title insurance is issued by the same attorneys who review your agreement of sale, conduct the title examination, and attend your settlement. You get comprehensive legal protection from start to finish, at the same cost you would pay anywhere else.
