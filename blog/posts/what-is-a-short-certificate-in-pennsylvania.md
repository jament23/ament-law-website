It's a common scenario: a loved one passes away and the bank or financial advisor tells you to go to the courthouse and get a "Short Certificate." But nobody explains what that actually means or how to do it. Here's what you need to know.

## What Is a Short Certificate?

A Short Certificate is a legal document issued by the Register of Wills that certifies the appointment of an executor (if there is a will) or an administrator (if there is no will) of an estate. Banks and financial institutions require this document before they will allow you to access or manage a deceased person's accounts.

## How to Get a Short Certificate in Pennsylvania

### Step 1: Gather Your Documents

Before visiting the Register of Wills office at the county courthouse, gather the original will (if one exists), the death certificate, and a list of the deceased's assets.

### Step 2: File a Petition

You must file a petition with the Register of Wills for the Grant of Letters Testamentary (if there is a will) or Letters of Administration (if there is no will). This petition formally requests the opening of probate and the appointment of the executor or administrator.

### Step 3: Receive the Short Certificate

Once the petition is approved, the Register of Wills issues the Short Certificate. This document provides the legal authority to act on behalf of the estate.

### Step 4: Use the Short Certificate

With the Short Certificate in hand, the executor or administrator can approach banks, financial institutions, and other entities to manage, transfer, or close accounts of the deceased.

## What Comes After?

Obtaining the Short Certificate is just the beginning of the probate process. The executor or administrator must also carry out additional duties, including notifying beneficiaries, paying debts and taxes, and eventually distributing the estate's assets.
