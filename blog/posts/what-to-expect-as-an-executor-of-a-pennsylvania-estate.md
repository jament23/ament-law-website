If you have been named as the executor of a loved one's estate, you may be wondering what this role entails. Being an executor in Pennsylvania comes with important legal responsibilities.

## What Does an Executor Do?

An executor (also called a personal representative) is responsible for administering a deceased person's estate according to their will and Pennsylvania law. This involves initiating probate proceedings, managing estate assets, paying debts and taxes, and distributing remaining assets to beneficiaries.

## The Probate Process

Most estates in Pennsylvania go through probate. The executor must file the will with the Register of Wills, petition for Letters Testamentary, notify heirs, beneficiaries, and creditors, inventory and value all estate assets, pay valid debts and file tax returns, and distribute assets according to the will.

## Potential Challenges

Executors may face disputes among beneficiaries, unexpected creditor claims, complex tax matters, and legal compliance issues. Failure to meet deadlines or comply with probate laws can result in personal liability.

## Executor Compensation

Pennsylvania law allows executors to receive reasonable compensation based on the size and complexity of the estate, the time and effort required, and any disputes or legal hurdles encountered. Executor fees may be subject to court approval.

## Why Work with an Attorney?

Given the complexities of estate administration, many executors choose to work with an estate attorney to ensure compliance with Pennsylvania probate laws. An attorney can assist with filing documents correctly and on time, handling complex tax matters, guiding you through each step of probate, and protecting you from personal liability.
