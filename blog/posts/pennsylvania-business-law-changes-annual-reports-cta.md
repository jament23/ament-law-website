<div class="quick-answer">
<p>Pennsylvania business owners have faced a wave of new compliance requirements over the past two years — including mandatory annual reports, federal beneficial ownership reporting, and updated LLC governance rules. If you formed a business and haven't reviewed your compliance obligations recently, here is what has changed and what you may need to do.</p>

## Pennsylvania Annual Reports: The Biggest Change for Small Businesses

For most of Pennsylvania's history, business entities filed a report with the Department of State only once every ten years — the decennial report. That system is gone.

Beginning in 2025, Pennsylvania requires most business entities to file an **annual report** with the Department of State each year. This applies to:

- Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)
- Corporations (both for-profit and nonprofit)
- Limited Partnerships
- Limited Liability Partnerships

The annual report is filed online through the Pennsylvania Department of State's business portal and requires basic information about the entity — registered address, registered agent, and principal officers or members. The filing fee is modest, but the consequence of missing it is not: failure to file can result in administrative dissolution of your entity.

**What this means for you:** If you formed an LLC in Pennsylvania and haven't filed an annual report, you may be at risk of losing your entity's good standing. Check your filing status through the Pennsylvania Department of State's online portal and make sure you are current.

## The Corporate Transparency Act: Federal Beneficial Ownership Reporting

The Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, created a new federal reporting obligation for most small businesses. Under the CTA, "reporting companies" — which includes most LLCs, corporations, and similar entities — must file a Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) report with FinCEN identifying the individuals who own or control the company.

The BOI report requires the name, date of birth, address, and a copy of a government-issued ID for each beneficial owner — defined as anyone who owns 25% or more of the company or exercises substantial control over it.

**The current status of CTA enforcement** has been subject to ongoing litigation and regulatory updates. Reporting deadlines have shifted multiple times. The practical advice: consult with your attorney about your specific entity's current filing obligations, as the landscape has been fluid.

**Key exemptions to know:** Large operating companies (more than 20 full-time employees, more than $5 million in gross receipts, and a physical presence in the US), regulated entities like banks and insurance companies, and certain inactive entities are exempt from reporting. Most small business LLCs and holding companies are not exempt.

## Updated Pennsylvania LLC Act Provisions

Pennsylvania's Uniform Limited Liability Company Act continues to be updated through case law and legislative interpretation. A few areas worth attention for small business owners:

**Operating agreement primacy:** Pennsylvania law gives broad deference to the operating agreement as the governing document of an LLC. This makes a well-drafted operating agreement more important than ever — the default statutory rules may not reflect what you actually want to happen if a member leaves, dies, or becomes incapacitated.

**Series LLCs:** Pennsylvania recognizes series LLCs, which allow a single LLC to have separate series with distinct assets and liabilities. Real estate investors in particular have shown interest in this structure, though it comes with complexity and requires careful drafting.

**Single-member LLCs and charging orders:** Pennsylvania courts have continued to develop the law around creditor access to single-member LLC interests. If you are using an LLC for asset protection purposes, make sure your attorney has reviewed the current state of the law — the protections may be different than you expect.

## What Business Owners Should Do Now

**1. Verify your annual report status.** Log into the Pennsylvania Department of State's business portal and confirm your entity is in good standing and current on annual reports.

**2. Address your BOI filing.** Even with the litigation uncertainty around the CTA, consult with your attorney about your beneficial ownership reporting obligations. Getting this wrong carries civil and criminal penalties.

**3. Review your operating agreement.** If your operating agreement was drafted more than three years ago, or if your business circumstances have changed — new members, new lines of business, changes in ownership — it may need updating.

**4. Consider your entity structure holistically.** Annual report requirements, BOI filing obligations, and tax treatment all interact. If you are operating multiple entities, a structure review may identify opportunities to simplify.
