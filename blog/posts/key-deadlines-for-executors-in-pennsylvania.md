Serving as an executor is both an honor and a legal responsibility. One of the most important aspects of the role is staying on top of key deadlines. Missing a deadline can result in delays, penalties, or personal liability.

## Immediately After Death

- **Secure the will** — locate and secure the original will (if one exists).
- **Safeguard assets** — protect the decedent's property and financial accounts from loss or damage.
- **Arrange burial or cremation** — this responsibility often falls on the executor or next of kin.

## Within the First Few Weeks

- **File the will** with the Register of Wills in the county where the decedent lived.
- **Petition for Letters Testamentary** to be formally appointed as executor.
- **Obtain Short Certificates** to access and manage estate accounts.
- **Publish notice to creditors** — this starts the one-year statute of limitations for creditor claims.
- **Send notice to heirs and beneficiaries** — notify all interested parties of your appointment.
- **File Certificate of Notice** with the Register of Wills confirming required notifications were sent.

## Within Three Months

- **Inheritance tax prepayment discount** — Pennsylvania offers a **5% discount** if inheritance tax is paid within three months of the decedent's death. Work with an attorney or accountant to calculate the estimated tax due.

## Within Nine Months

- **Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500)** — report all taxable assets to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue and pay the applicable tax.
- **Estate inventory** — file a complete inventory of all probate assets, including real estate, bank accounts, personal property, and other items.

## Within One Year

- **Creditor claims deadline** — creditors have one year from the date of the published notice to file claims against the estate.
- **Final income tax returns** — file the decedent's final federal and state income tax returns.

## Final Steps

- **Prepare an accounting** — formal or informal, detailing all receipts, disbursements, and distributions.
- **Distribute remaining assets** to beneficiaries in accordance with the will or intestacy law.
- **Close the estate** — file the final account with the court if required.

## Protect Yourself as Executor

Mistakes in probate can be costly — and executors can be held personally liable. Working with an experienced probate attorney ensures full compliance, minimizes delays, and protects against liability.
