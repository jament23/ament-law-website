Creating a will is one of the most important steps you can take to protect your assets and ensure your loved ones are taken care of after your death. Without a will, your estate will be distributed according to Pennsylvania's intestacy laws — which may not reflect your wishes.

## Requirements for a Valid Will in Pennsylvania

To create a valid will in Pennsylvania, you must be at least 18 years old and of sound mind — meaning you understand the nature and value of your assets and the effect of making a will.

Pennsylvania requires wills to be **written** (typed or handwritten). Oral wills are not recognized. While handwritten (holographic) wills are technically allowed, they must meet all other legal requirements and are highly discouraged due to potential challenges in probate.

The will must be **signed by you** — the "testator."

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Take Inventory of Your Assets

Before drafting your will, list your assets: real estate, bank accounts, retirement accounts, investments, life insurance, vehicles, and valuable personal property.

### 2. Choose Your Beneficiaries

Decide who will inherit your assets. This can include family members, friends, charities, or other organizations.

### 3. Name an Executor

Your executor (personal representative) will be responsible for administering your estate. Choose someone trustworthy, organized, and willing to serve.

### 4. Name a Guardian for Minor Children

If you have children under 18, your will should name a guardian — someone who will care for them if both parents pass away.

### 5. Draft Your Will

While you can use online templates, working with an experienced estate planning attorney ensures your will is legally sound and customized to your needs.

### 6. Sign Your Will with Witnesses

Although Pennsylvania does not legally require witnesses for a will to be valid, it's best practice to have **two disinterested adults** witness your signature. You and your witnesses should sign in each other's presence.

### 7. Add a Self-Proving Affidavit

A self-proving affidavit is a notarized statement signed by you and your witnesses that confirms the validity of your will. This helps your executor avoid delays in probate court by eliminating the need for witnesses to testify after your death.

### 8. Store Your Will Safely

Place your signed will in a secure location — such as a fireproof safe or locked filing cabinet. Do not store it in a bank safety deposit box unless others can access it. Let your executor know where to find it.

## When to Update Your Will

Review and update your will after major life events: marriage, divorce, birth of a child, death of a beneficiary, significant changes in assets, or a move to a new state.
