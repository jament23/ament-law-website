<div class="quick-answer">
<p>Several significant changes have affected estate planning in Pennsylvania over the past two years — including the potential sunset of elevated federal estate tax exemptions, updates to Pennsylvania's unclaimed property law, and ongoing developments around small estate procedures. If you haven't reviewed your estate plan recently, now is the time.</p>

## The Federal Estate Tax Exemption: The Biggest Planning Issue of the Decade

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) roughly doubled the federal estate and gift tax exemption — from approximately $5.5 million per person to over $13 million per person. For a married couple, that meant over $27 million could pass free of federal estate tax.

Those elevated exemptions were always scheduled to sunset at the end of 2025, reverting to pre-TCJA levels (approximately $6–7 million per person, adjusted for inflation). Whether Congress acted to extend or permanently change the exemption is a critical factor in your estate plan.

**Why this matters even for modest estates:** Most Pennsylvania families are not currently subject to federal estate tax at any exemption level. But the sunset affects estate planning strategy in important ways:

- **Irrevocable trusts and gifting strategies** designed around the elevated exemption may need to be reviewed
- **Portability elections** — the ability of a surviving spouse to use a deceased spouse's unused exemption — remain important regardless of where the exemption lands
- **Business owners and farmers** with illiquid assets may face estate tax exposure that wasn't a concern under elevated exemptions

If your estate plan was drafted with the assumption of a $13 million exemption and that assumption has changed, your plan deserves a fresh look.

## Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax: What Hasn't Changed (And Why That Matters)

Pennsylvania remains one of only six states with an inheritance tax. The rates have not changed:

- **0%** — transfers to a surviving spouse
- **0%** — transfers to charities
- **4.5%** — transfers to direct descendants (children, grandchildren) and direct ancestors (parents)
- **12%** — transfers to siblings
- **15%** — transfers to all other beneficiaries

One change worth noting: transfers to **stepchildren** are taxed at 4.5% — the same rate as biological children. This is relevant for blended families and should be reflected in how your estate plan addresses beneficiary designations and asset titling.

The **5% early-payment discount** remains available: if inheritance tax is paid within three months of death, the estate receives a 5% discount on the amount paid. This is a meaningful savings that executors should plan for.

## Pennsylvania's Unclaimed Property Law: A Hidden Estate Planning Issue

Pennsylvania has one of the most aggressive unclaimed property programs in the country. Under Pennsylvania's Disposition of Abandoned and Unclaimed Property Act, financial assets — including bank accounts, brokerage accounts, insurance proceeds, and even safe deposit box contents — that go unclaimed for a defined period are escheated to the Commonwealth.

**The dormancy periods are shorter than most people expect:**
- Bank accounts: 3 years of inactivity
- Stocks and dividends: 3 years
- Life insurance proceeds: 3 years after the policy matures or is payable
- Safe deposit boxes: 3 years after expiration of the lease

**What this means for estate planning:** If your estate plan leaves assets to beneficiaries who may not know to claim them — or if your estate includes old accounts your executor might not discover — those assets can be lost to the Commonwealth before they're distributed.

Good estate planning addresses this through a comprehensive asset inventory, clear beneficiary designations, and executor instructions that cover all account types including older or dormant accounts.

## Small Estate Procedures: Ongoing Developments

Pennsylvania's small estate threshold for Voluntary Administration — currently set at $50,000 in probate assets — has been the subject of ongoing legislative attention. There have been proposals to increase this threshold to better reflect current asset values, as $50,000 no longer goes as far as it once did.

If the threshold is increased, more estates will qualify for simplified administration — potentially avoiding the full Register of Wills process. Estate plans that currently route assets through probate based on an assumption about the small estate threshold may need adjustment if the law changes.

We will update this post as any legislative changes are enacted.

## SECURE Act 2.0 and Inherited IRAs: Still Creating Problems

The SECURE Act and its follow-on legislation (SECURE 2.0) eliminated the "stretch IRA" for most non-spouse beneficiaries, replacing it with a 10-year rule that requires inherited retirement accounts to be fully distributed within 10 years of the original owner's death. For many beneficiaries — particularly those in their peak earning years — this creates a significant income tax problem.

Estate plans drafted before the SECURE Act may name trusts as IRA beneficiaries under rules that no longer work as intended. Conduit trusts, accumulation trusts, and other trust structures designed around the old stretch IRA rules may produce unintended tax consequences under current law.

If your estate plan names a trust as a beneficiary of an IRA or 401(k), it needs to be reviewed in light of SECURE Act changes.

## When to Review Your Estate Plan

As a general rule, review your estate plan when:
- A major tax law changes (and one just did, or is about to)
- You experience a major life event — marriage, divorce, death of a spouse or beneficiary, birth of a child or grandchild
- Your assets change significantly — sale of a business, inheritance, major real estate transaction
- You move to a new state
- Three to five years have passed since your last review
