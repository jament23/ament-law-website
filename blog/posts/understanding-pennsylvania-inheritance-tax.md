One of the most common questions we hear from clients is: *"Will my family have to pay taxes when I die?"* In Pennsylvania, the answer is almost always yes — because Pennsylvania is one of only six states that imposes an **inheritance tax** on assets transferred at death.

Unlike the federal estate tax, which only applies to estates exceeding $13.61 million (as of 2024), Pennsylvania's inheritance tax applies to most estates regardless of size. Understanding how this tax works is essential to protecting your family's financial future.

## Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Rates

Pennsylvania's inheritance tax is based on the **relationship** between the deceased and the beneficiary — not the size of the estate. The current rates are:

- **0%** — Transfers to a surviving spouse or to a parent from a child under age 21
- **4.5%** — Transfers to direct descendants (children, grandchildren) and lineal heirs
- **12%** — Transfers to siblings
- **15%** — Transfers to all other beneficiaries (nieces, nephews, friends, unmarried partners, etc.)

These rates apply to most assets in the estate, including real estate, bank accounts, investments, and personal property.

## What Assets Are Subject to the Tax?

The inheritance tax applies broadly, including real property located in Pennsylvania, tangible personal property (vehicles, jewelry, collectibles), bank and brokerage accounts, retirement accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s), business interests, and certain jointly held property.

## Key Exemptions

Not everything is taxable. Notable exemptions include life insurance proceeds payable to a named beneficiary, certain farmland and agricultural property (if qualifying conditions are met), property owned jointly between spouses, assets passing to qualifying charitable organizations, and the first $3,500 of transfers to each beneficiary from estates of decedents who died after July 1, 1994.

## Filing Deadlines and the 5% Discount

The Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax return (REV-1500 for residents) is due **nine months** after the date of death. However, Pennsylvania offers an important incentive: a **5% discount** on the tax due if it is paid within **three months** of death.

For a beneficiary inheriting $500,000 at the 4.5% rate, the tax would be $22,500. Paying within three months would save $1,125. That discount adds up quickly for larger estates.

## Strategies to Reduce Inheritance Tax

### Maximize the Spousal Exemption

Transfers between spouses are tax-free. For married couples, structuring ownership so that assets pass to the surviving spouse first can defer — and in some cases significantly reduce — the overall tax burden.

### Use Irrevocable Trusts

Assets placed in an irrevocable trust more than one year before death are generally not subject to Pennsylvania inheritance tax. This requires advance planning, but the tax savings can be substantial for larger estates.

### Lifetime Gifting

Gifts made more than one year before death are not included in the taxable estate. Pennsylvania does not have its own gift tax, so lifetime gifting can be an effective strategy. However, gifts made within one year of death are pulled back into the estate for inheritance tax purposes.

### Life Insurance Planning

Life insurance proceeds paid to a named beneficiary are exempt from Pennsylvania inheritance tax. For individuals with significant assets passing to non-spouse beneficiaries (especially at the 12% or 15% rate), life insurance can be a powerful tool to offset the tax burden.

### Charitable Giving

Bequests to qualifying charities are fully exempt from inheritance tax. Incorporating charitable giving into your estate plan can reduce the taxable estate while supporting causes you care about.

## A Note About the Federal Estate Tax

Pennsylvania's inheritance tax is separate from the federal estate tax. Most Pennsylvania residents will not owe federal estate tax (the exemption is over $13 million), but virtually all estates will owe some Pennsylvania inheritance tax. The two taxes can overlap for very large estates, making coordinated planning essential.

## Plan Ahead

The most effective inheritance tax strategies require advance planning. Many of the tools available — irrevocable trusts, lifetime gifts, ownership restructuring — must be implemented well before death to be effective.
