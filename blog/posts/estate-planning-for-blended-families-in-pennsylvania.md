Blended families — families that include children from prior relationships, stepchildren, or second spouses — face estate planning challenges that traditional families do not. Without careful planning, Pennsylvania's default inheritance rules can produce results that no one intended: a surviving spouse may receive more than planned, children from a prior marriage may be unintentionally disinherited, or family conflict may erupt over assets that were never clearly designated.

At Ament Law Group, we work with blended families regularly and understand the competing interests that must be balanced. The goal is to create a plan that provides for your current spouse while ensuring your children from a prior relationship are protected.

## How Pennsylvania Law Treats Blended Families

### Intestacy (No Will)

If you die without a will in Pennsylvania, the intestacy statutes (20 Pa.C.S. § 2101 et seq.) determine who inherits your estate. For a married person with children from a prior relationship, the surviving spouse receives the first $50,000 of the estate plus one-half of the balance. The remaining one-half goes to the decedent's children. This split may or may not reflect your actual wishes.

For example, if your estate is worth $500,000, your surviving spouse would receive $275,000 (the first $50,000 plus half of $450,000) and your children would share $225,000. If you intended for your children to receive more — or less — intestacy law does not accommodate that preference.

### The Elective Share

Pennsylvania gives a surviving spouse the right to claim an "elective share" of one-third of the decedent's estate, regardless of what the will says (20 Pa.C.S. § 2203). This means that even if your will leaves everything to your children, your spouse can elect to take one-third of the estate. The elective share applies to the augmented estate, which includes most assets the decedent owned or controlled at death.

This right exists to prevent disinheritance of a surviving spouse, but in blended families, it can create tension. If your will leaves the bulk of your estate to your children and your spouse exercises the elective share, your children may receive significantly less than you intended.

## Common Planning Strategies

### Marital Trusts

One of the most effective tools for blended families is a marital trust — sometimes called a QTIP trust (Qualified Terminable Interest Property trust). This arrangement allows you to provide income and support to your surviving spouse during their lifetime while preserving the trust principal for your children after the surviving spouse's death.

With a QTIP trust, the surviving spouse receives all income from the trust, the trustee can distribute principal to the spouse for health, education, maintenance, and support, and upon the surviving spouse's death, the remaining trust assets pass to your children (or other designated beneficiaries). This structure prevents the surviving spouse from redirecting the assets to their own children or a new partner, while still providing for their needs during their lifetime.

### Prenuptial and Postnuptial Agreements

A prenuptial or postnuptial agreement can waive or modify the elective share right, define which assets remain separate property, and establish clear expectations about inheritance for both spouses. In Pennsylvania, prenuptial agreements are enforceable if they meet the requirements of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act (23 Pa.C.S. § 3101 et seq.), including full financial disclosure by both parties and the absence of duress or unconscionability.

For blended families, a prenuptial agreement is not about distrust — it is about clarity. It ensures that both spouses understand and agree on how assets will be handled, which reduces the potential for conflict after one spouse passes away.

### Beneficiary Designations

Retirement accounts, life insurance policies, and payable-on-death accounts pass by beneficiary designation, not by your will or trust. In blended families, it is essential to review all beneficiary designations to ensure they align with your overall plan. A common mistake is naming your new spouse as the sole beneficiary of your retirement accounts while your will leaves everything to your children — creating contradictory instructions that can lead to disputes.

We review every beneficiary designation as part of our estate planning process and recommend updates to ensure consistency across your entire plan.

### Life Insurance

Life insurance can play an important role in blended family planning by providing liquidity to fund bequests. For example, if you want to leave your home to your surviving spouse but also want your children to receive an equivalent amount, a life insurance policy naming your children as beneficiaries can accomplish this without forcing anyone to sell property.

## Stepchildren and Pennsylvania Law

It is important to understand that stepchildren do not inherit from a stepparent under Pennsylvania intestacy law. If you want your stepchildren to receive part of your estate, you must specifically name them in your will or trust. Conversely, if you do not want your stepchildren to inherit, you generally do not need to take any action — but it is still wise to state your intentions clearly in your estate plan to prevent misunderstandings or challenges.

## Having the Conversation

Estate planning for blended families requires honest conversations — with your spouse, with your children, and with your attorney. These conversations can be uncomfortable, but they are far less painful than the disputes that arise when a plan is unclear or when family members are surprised by the terms of a will or trust after a death.

We encourage clients to discuss their plans openly with their families when appropriate, and we are available to help facilitate those conversations in a constructive way.
