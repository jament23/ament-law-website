Losing a parent is one of the most difficult experiences in life, and the legal responsibilities that follow can feel overwhelming. If your parent lived in Pennsylvania — whether in Westmoreland County, Allegheny County, or elsewhere in Western PA — there are specific legal steps you need to take in the days, weeks, and months after their death.

This guide walks you through the process in practical terms, so you know what to expect and when to act.

## The First Week

**Obtain certified death certificates.** You will need multiple certified copies — typically 8 to 12 — because banks, insurance companies, the Register of Wills, and government agencies each require an original. The funeral home typically orders these from the county or the Pennsylvania Department of Health, but you should request enough copies upfront because ordering additional copies later takes time.

**Locate the will and other important documents.** Check your parent's home, safe deposit box (if you have access), and files for their will, trust documents, powers of attorney, insurance policies, deeds, and financial account statements. If your parent worked with an attorney, contact them — they may hold original documents.

**Notify Social Security and any pension or benefit providers.** Social Security should be notified promptly, as any benefits received after the date of death must be returned. The funeral home often handles this notification.

## Within the First Month

**File the will with the Register of Wills.** In Pennsylvania, the will must be filed with the Register of Wills in the county where your parent resided. For Westmoreland County, this is at the courthouse in Greensburg. For Allegheny County, it is at the City-County Building in downtown Pittsburgh. Even if probate is not required for all assets, the will should be filed.

**Open the estate and obtain Short Certificates.** The Register of Wills will issue Letters Testamentary (if there is a will) or Letters of Administration (if there is no will) and Short Certificates. Short Certificates are the documents that give the executor or administrator legal authority to manage the estate — banks and financial institutions will require them before releasing any information or funds.

**Hire a probate attorney.** While Pennsylvania does not require an attorney for [probate](/practice-areas/probate-administration/), the process involves legal deadlines, fiduciary duties, tax filings, and potential personal liability for the executor. An experienced probate attorney handles the complexity so you can focus on your family. At Ament Law Group, we guide executors through every step from the initial filing through final distribution.

## Months Two Through Six

**Notify creditors.** Pennsylvania law requires the executor to advertise the estate opening in the local legal journal and a newspaper of general circulation. This puts creditors on notice and starts a one-year claims period, after which most claims are barred.

**Inventory and secure assets.** The executor must identify, inventory, and protect all estate assets — including real estate, bank accounts, investment accounts, vehicles, personal property, and any business interests. Real property should be insured and maintained; financial accounts should be retitled into the estate's name.

**Pay ongoing obligations.** Keep up with mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance premiums, and utility bills on any real estate the estate owns. Failing to maintain property or pay obligations can expose the executor to personal liability.

## Months Six Through Nine

**Prepare and file the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500).** This return is due nine months after the date of death. Pennsylvania offers a 5% discount if the inheritance tax is paid within three months of death — a meaningful savings on larger estates. The tax rates depend on the beneficiary's relationship to the decedent: 0% for a surviving spouse, 4.5% for children and grandchildren, 12% for siblings, and 15% for everyone else.

**File the decedent's final income tax returns.** The executor must file your parent's final federal and state income tax returns for the year of death. If the estate earns income (such as interest, dividends, or rental income) during administration, a separate estate income tax return (Form 1041) may also be required.

## Final Steps

**Prepare an accounting and distribute assets.** Once all debts, taxes, and expenses are paid, the executor prepares a formal or informal accounting of all estate transactions. Beneficiaries sign receipts and releases confirming their distributions. If all beneficiaries agree, a Family Settlement Agreement can simplify this process.

**Close the estate.** After all distributions are made and all tax clearances are received, the executor can close the estate.
