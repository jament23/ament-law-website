<div class="quick-answer">
<p>Online legal document services and AI drafting tools have made it easier than ever to generate a will, an LLC operating agreement, or a power of attorney in minutes. The documents look professional, the process feels thorough, and the price is a fraction of what an attorney charges. The problem is not that these tools always produce bad documents. The problem is that you almost certainly cannot tell the difference between a document that works and one that doesn't — until it matters most.</p>

## The Dunning-Kruger Problem in Legal Documents

In 1999, psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger published research demonstrating something that lawyers see constantly in practice: people with limited knowledge in a given area tend to significantly overestimate their own competence, precisely because they lack the expertise to recognize what they do not know.

The researchers summarized it plainly: incompetence robs people of the ability to recognize their own incompetence.

This is not an insult. It is a cognitive pattern that applies to all of us in areas outside our expertise. A skilled attorney drafting their own surgical consent form, a talented surgeon negotiating their own commercial lease, a brilliant accountant writing their own custody agreement — all of them face the same problem. They know enough to feel confident. They do not know enough to know what they are getting wrong.

Legal documents are a nearly perfect environment for Dunning-Kruger errors. A will, a trust, or a power of attorney generated by an online service looks exactly the same whether it works or whether it contains a fatal flaw. The formatting is clean. The language sounds authoritative. The document feels finished. There is nothing about a defective legal document that announces itself as defective — not to a layperson, and not until the moment it is tested.

## What "Tested" Means for a Legal Document

A will is tested when the person who signed it dies. A power of attorney is tested when the person who signed it becomes incapacitated. A trust is tested when the grantor dies or becomes unable to manage their affairs.

These are not convenient moments for discovering that something went wrong. The person whose intent the document was meant to express is gone or unavailable. The family members who need the document to work are grieving, stressed, and often in conflict. The financial institutions, courts, and government agencies that need to accept the document will not be moved by the argument that it seemed fine at the time.

This is fundamentally different from most consumer products. A poorly designed chair breaks while you are sitting in it. A poorly drafted legal document appears to function perfectly until the exact moment it needs to work — and then fails completely, at the worst possible time, with no opportunity to fix it.

## Where Online Documents Actually Go Wrong

Online services and AI tools are not bad at generating generic legal language. They are often quite good at it. The failure modes are subtler and more serious:

**Pennsylvania-specific requirements not met.** Pennsylvania has specific execution requirements for wills (two witnesses, no interested witnesses), powers of attorney (notary plus two witnesses, specific statutory notice language), and healthcare directives. An online tool that generates documents for use in any state may not satisfy Pennsylvania's specific requirements — or may satisfy them in a way that is technically compliant but practically problematic.

**The questions the tool doesn't ask.** Online services ask you questions to generate your document. They ask reasonable questions — who are your beneficiaries, who is your executor, what percentage goes to each child. What they cannot ask are the questions you do not know to raise: What happens if a beneficiary predeceases you and leaves children of their own? What if your executor is also a beneficiary and there is a conflict of interest? What if one of your children has a disability and a direct inheritance would disqualify them from government benefits? What if you have a blended family with children from different relationships? The tool cannot ask about contingencies you have not thought of. An attorney asks precisely those questions — because we have seen what happens when they are not addressed.

**Documents that conflict with each other.** A common problem we see is a will that leaves assets to named beneficiaries that conflicts with beneficiary designations on retirement accounts, life insurance policies, or jointly titled property. The will says one thing; the beneficiary form says another. In Pennsylvania, the beneficiary designation wins — which may not be what you intended. An online tool that generates only your will cannot see your beneficiary designations.

**Documents that conflict with Pennsylvania law.** Legal requirements change. A power of attorney drafted under the pre-2015 Pennsylvania Power of Attorney Act may not satisfy the current Act's requirements, including the mandatory notice and acknowledgment provisions that financial institutions now require. A trust drafted before the SECURE Act may have conduit provisions that produce unintended income tax consequences for retirement account beneficiaries. An AI tool trained on data that predates a statutory change will not know that the law has changed.

**The impossible-to-anticipate future fact.** Your estate plan is a document about the future. It needs to work not just for the family you have today, but for the family you will have — or will have lost — when the document is actually used. Online tools cannot plan for divorce, estrangement, addiction, disability, a child who predeceases you, or the grandchild who is born after the document is signed. An attorney builds in contingencies. A form generates a snapshot.

## "But I've Seen the Document — It Looks Fine"

This is the Dunning-Kruger effect in action. The document looks fine because you do not have the expertise to see what is missing or misaligned. Neither, in most cases, does your neighbor who also used the service, or the family member who "looked it over."

I am not saying this to be condescending. I am saying it because I have spent years in probate court helping families sort out the consequences of documents that "looked fine." I have seen a will that was valid on its face fail because it was signed without the required witnesses. I have seen a trust that was funded correctly at signing but never updated when the grantor sold the house that was the primary asset. I have seen a power of attorney rejected by a bank because it lacked the statutory notice language required by current Pennsylvania law — a document the client had paid an online service to generate.

The clients in each of those situations were not careless people. They were people who did what seemed reasonable with the information they had. They did not know what they did not know.

## A Note on AI Specifically

AI drafting tools add a new dimension to this problem. A sophisticated AI can generate a document that is not merely generic but that sounds remarkably customized and authoritative. The language is confident. The structure is logical. The output feels like something a professional produced.

The problem is that an AI tool — even a very good one — cannot exercise legal judgment. It cannot ask the follow-up question that changes the entire analysis. It cannot recognize that the fact pattern you just described triggers a rule that the question you asked does not implicate. It cannot take professional responsibility for the advice it gives, which means there is no accountability when something goes wrong.

AI is a powerful tool for lawyers who know how to use it. It is a dangerous tool for people who use it as a substitute for a lawyer, precisely because its outputs are polished enough to mask the gaps.

## What an Attorney Actually Provides

When you work with an estate planning attorney, you are not paying for document generation. A competent attorney uses software for that. What you are paying for is:

- Legal judgment about what your specific situation requires
- Questions you would not know to ask
- Knowledge of current Pennsylvania law and how it applies to your documents
- Coordination across your entire financial and legal picture
- Accountability — an attorney's license is on the line
- A professional relationship that allows you to come back when your circumstances change

For most Pennsylvania families, a complete [estate plan](/practice-areas/estate-planning/) — will, trust if needed, powers of attorney, and healthcare documents — costs less than a single month of a car payment. The cost of getting it wrong is measured in legal fees, family conflict, lost assets, and outcomes the client would never have chosen.

## The Bottom Line

Online document services and AI tools are not useless. For simple, low-stakes documents where the stakes of getting it wrong are modest, they may be perfectly adequate. For legal documents that govern what happens to your family, your assets, and your healthcare at the most vulnerable moments of your life, the margin for error is zero — and you are not equipped to know whether you are within that margin.

Use technology to research, to learn, and to understand your options. Then work with a licensed Pennsylvania attorney to make it right.
