If you own rental property in Pennsylvania, someone has probably told you to "put it in an LLC." It is good advice in many situations — but not all of them. Here is what you actually need to know before making the decision.

## What an LLC Does (and Doesn't Do)

A limited liability company creates a legal barrier between your rental property and your personal assets. If a tenant or visitor is injured on the property and sues, a properly maintained LLC limits their claim to the assets inside the LLC — not your personal savings, your home, or your other investments.

What an LLC does **not** do:

- It does not protect you from personal negligence. If you personally cause injury through your own actions, the LLC will not shield you.
- It does not eliminate the need for insurance. Landlord liability insurance remains your primary line of defense.
- It does not reduce your taxes automatically. An LLC is a pass-through entity by default, meaning rental income is still reported on your personal tax return.

## The Case for an LLC

An LLC makes the most sense when you have **significant personal assets to protect** beyond the rental property itself. If you own a home, have retirement savings, or run a business, an LLC creates separation that can prevent a judgment against your rental property from reaching those other assets.

It also makes sense when you own **multiple rental properties**. Holding each property (or a group of properties) in a separate LLC means a liability event at one property cannot affect the others.

For Pennsylvania landlords, forming an LLC is straightforward under the Pennsylvania Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (15 Pa.C.S. § 8811 et seq.). The filing fee is $125 with the Department of State, and the entity can be formed in a matter of days.

## The Case Against (or at Least: Not Yet)

An LLC adds complexity. You need a separate bank account, separate bookkeeping, and you must treat the LLC as a genuinely separate entity. If you commingle personal and LLC funds, fail to maintain proper records, or treat the LLC as an alter ego, a court can "pierce the veil" and hold you personally liable anyway.

An LLC can also complicate **financing**. Most residential mortgage lenders will not lend to an LLC, or will require the loan to be in your personal name with the property later transferred. Transferring a mortgaged property into an LLC can technically trigger a due-on-sale clause, though in practice most lenders do not enforce this for single-member LLCs. Still, it is a risk worth discussing with your attorney and lender before you proceed.

If you own a single rental property with modest equity and carry a solid landlord insurance policy, the cost and administrative burden of an LLC may not be justified — at least not yet.

## Transfer Tax Considerations

When you transfer a property into an LLC, Pennsylvania realty transfer tax may apply. However, an exemption exists under 72 P.S. § 8102-C when the transfer is to an entity where the same persons own the entire interest. For a single-member LLC owned by the same person who owns the property, the transfer should be exempt.

Important: this exemption can be clawed back if the ownership of the LLC changes within three years of the transfer. If you plan to bring in partners or sell an interest in the LLC, the timing matters.

## How the LLC Fits into Your Estate Plan

Your LLC interest is an asset that must be addressed in your estate plan. When you die, someone needs the authority to manage or transfer that interest — and an operating agreement that does not address succession can create serious problems.

At Ament Law Group, we draft LLC operating agreements that include succession provisions coordinated with the owner's estate plan. We also ensure that the LLC interest is properly addressed in the owner's will or trust, so the transition is seamless for the family.

## Our Recommendation

For most Pennsylvania landlords with two or more rental properties and meaningful personal assets to protect, an LLC is worth the modest cost and administrative effort. For a single property with good insurance coverage, it may not be necessary right away — but it is worth planning for as your portfolio grows.

The worst approach is forming an LLC and then not maintaining it properly. A neglected LLC provides a false sense of security while adding cost and complexity for no benefit.
