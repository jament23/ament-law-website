<div class="quick-answer">
<p>Transferring your home to your children during your lifetime is one of the most common — and most misunderstood — [estate planning](/practice-areas/estate-planning/) moves we see. It feels simple, it seems like it avoids probate, and it appears to protect the home from nursing home costs. In reality, an outright lifetime transfer often creates more problems than it solves. Before you sign a deed, here is what you need to understand.</p>

## Why People Do It — And Why the Reasoning Often Falls Short

The three most common reasons clients tell us they want to transfer their home to their children while alive are:

**To avoid probate.** A lifetime transfer does avoid probate for that asset — but Pennsylvania probate is not the burden people assume it is. For most estates, probate is straightforward and relatively inexpensive. Avoiding probate at the cost of significant tax liability is rarely a good trade.

**To protect the home from nursing home costs.** This is the most common motivator — and the most dangerous misconception. Pennsylvania Medicaid has a five-year lookback period. A home transferred within five years of a Medicaid application is subject to a penalty period. Unless you are transferring the home more than five years before you might need nursing home care, this strategy does not accomplish what you intend.

**To simplify the estate.** Transferring assets before death can simplify estate administration in some cases, but an outright deed transfer creates its own complications — particularly around taxes and control.

## The Capital Gains Tax Problem

This is the issue that surprises families most often, and it is a significant one.

When you leave your home to your children through your estate — either through your will or as a beneficiary designation — your children receive the property with a **stepped-up basis** equal to the fair market value of the home at your date of death. If they sell the home immediately after inheriting it, they owe little or no capital gains tax, because their basis equals the sale price.

When you transfer your home to your children during your lifetime as a gift, they receive your original cost basis — what you paid for the home, plus improvements. If you paid $80,000 for your home in 1985 and it is now worth $350,000, your children's basis after a lifetime gift is still $80,000. When they sell, they owe capital gains tax on $270,000 of gain.

The difference between a lifetime transfer and an inheritance can easily cost your children $50,000 or more in capital gains taxes — on a transaction that was intended to benefit them.

## Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax on Lifetime Transfers

Pennsylvania imposes inheritance tax on transfers of property made within one year of death at a rate up to 15% of the value transferred. Transfers to direct descendants (children) within one year of death are taxed at 4.5% — the same rate that would apply at death. The one-year rule means that a transfer made shortly before death does not escape Pennsylvania inheritance tax.

Transfers made more than one year before death are generally not subject to Pennsylvania inheritance tax, which is one reason some clients consider earlier lifetime transfers. But this benefit must be weighed against the capital gains tax cost described above.

## The Loss of Control

An outright deed transfer is irrevocable. Once you sign and record the deed, your children own the home. You no longer do.

This has several practical consequences:

**You cannot sell the home without your children's consent.** If you later need to sell the home to fund your care, pay debts, or simply move, you need your children's cooperation — and their signatures on the deed.

**The home becomes subject to your children's creditors.** If a child has a judgment against them, gets divorced, or files for bankruptcy, their interest in your home may be at risk. What was intended as a gift to your child could be seized by their creditors.

**Family dynamics can change.** Relationships change. A child who seemed reliable and trustworthy at the time of transfer may not remain so. Once the deed is transferred, you have limited legal recourse.

## Better Alternatives to an Outright Transfer

Fortunately, there are planning techniques that accomplish the legitimate goals of a lifetime transfer without the drawbacks:

**Life estate deed:** You transfer the home but retain a life estate — the right to live in and use the property for the rest of your life. At your death, ownership passes automatically to the remainder beneficiaries (your children) without probate, and they receive a stepped-up basis. The home is still subject to Medicaid estate recovery, but it avoids the capital gains tax problem of an outright transfer.

**Irrevocable Medicaid Asset Protection Trust (MAPT):** For clients focused on Medicaid planning with sufficient lead time, transferring the home to an irrevocable trust can remove it from countable Medicaid resources after the five-year lookback period expires. You can retain the right to live in the home. The trust provides better asset protection than a life estate and still allows for a stepped-up basis at death in many structures.

**Revocable living trust:** If the primary goal is avoiding probate, a revocable trust accomplishes that without any of the tax or control problems of a lifetime transfer. The home is retitled into the trust during your lifetime, passes to your beneficiaries at death without probate, and your children still receive a stepped-up basis.

**Leaving it in your will:** For many families, the simplest answer is the best one. Leave the home through your will or as a beneficiary designation on a transfer-on-death deed. Pennsylvania probate is manageable, your children get the stepped-up basis, and you retain full control of the home during your lifetime.

## The Right Answer Depends on Your Situation

There is no single right answer for every family. The best approach depends on your health, your age, your Medicaid planning timeline, your relationship with your children, and your other assets. What works well for one family may be a significant mistake for another.
