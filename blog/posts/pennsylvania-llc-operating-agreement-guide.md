<div class="quick-answer">
<p>Forming an LLC in Pennsylvania is straightforward — file the Certificate of Organization with the Department of State, pay the filing fee, and your entity exists. But formation is only the beginning. Without a properly drafted operating agreement, your LLC is governed by Pennsylvania's default statutory rules, which were written for generic businesses and almost certainly do not reflect your specific intentions. Here is why that matters and what to do about it.</p>

## What Is an Operating Agreement?

An operating agreement is the governing document of your LLC. It establishes the rights and responsibilities of the members, determines how profits and losses are allocated, specifies how the LLC is managed, and addresses what happens when a member wants to leave, becomes incapacitated, or dies.

Pennsylvania law does not require an LLC to have an operating agreement. But the absence of one does not mean the LLC has no rules — it means the LLC is governed by the default provisions of Pennsylvania's Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (15 Pa. C.S. § 8821 et seq.). Those default rules were designed for the average LLC, not for yours.

## What Pennsylvania's Default Rules Actually Say

Without an operating agreement, here is how Pennsylvania law treats your LLC:

**Profit and loss allocation:** Profits and losses are split equally among members — regardless of how much each member contributed. If you contributed $90,000 and your partner contributed $10,000, you each receive 50% of the profits under the default rules.

**Management:** By default, a Pennsylvania LLC is member-managed, meaning all members have equal authority to bind the LLC and make management decisions. There is no mechanism for one member to have more decision-making authority than another without an operating agreement.

**Transfer of membership interests:** A member can transfer their economic interest (the right to receive distributions) to a third party, but the transferee does not automatically become a member with voting rights. However, this still creates a situation where a stranger is entitled to a share of your profits — not an outcome most business owners anticipate.

**Death or incapacity of a member:** Without operating agreement provisions addressing these events, the death or incapacity of a member can create serious disruption to the business — particularly in a two-member LLC where the remaining member may suddenly have limited authority to act alone.

**Dissolution:** Pennsylvania's default rules provide triggers for dissolution that may not align with your intentions. A well-drafted operating agreement specifies exactly what events will — and will not — trigger dissolution.

## What a Good Operating Agreement Covers

A properly drafted operating agreement for a Pennsylvania LLC should address:

**Membership and contributions:** Who are the members, what did each contribute, and what is each member's percentage interest? Are additional contributions required or permitted, and on what terms?

**Allocations and distributions:** How are profits and losses allocated? When are distributions made, and who decides? Are there any guaranteed payments to members?

**Management structure:** Is the LLC member-managed or manager-managed? If manager-managed, who are the managers, how are they appointed, and what decisions require member approval?

**Transfer restrictions:** Can a member sell or transfer their interest, and if so, do other members have a right of first refusal? What happens if a member receives a bona fide offer from a third party?

**Buyout provisions:** What happens when a member wants to exit the business? How is the interest valued, and how is it paid for? A poorly drafted — or absent — buyout provision is one of the most common sources of business disputes.

**Death, disability, and divorce:** These events can fundamentally alter the membership of your LLC. An operating agreement should address each one explicitly — including whether a deceased member's interest passes to their estate or is subject to a mandatory buyout.

**Deadlock resolution:** In a 50/50 LLC, what happens when the members cannot agree? Without a deadlock provision, the answer is often litigation.

## Single-Member LLCs Are Not Exempt

Many single-member LLC owners assume they do not need an operating agreement because there are no other members to have disputes with. This is a mistake for several reasons.

First, banks and lenders often require an operating agreement as a condition of opening a business account or approving a loan. Second, without an operating agreement, it can be harder to demonstrate that the LLC is a genuinely separate entity from you personally — which is relevant to maintaining your liability protection. Third, if you ever add a member, you will want governing documents already in place.

A single-member operating agreement does not need to be complex, but it should exist.

## The Cost of Not Having One

Operating agreement disputes are among the most expensive and disruptive business litigation matters we see. When business partners fall out and there is no operating agreement — or an inadequate one — the resolution often requires litigation over what the parties intended, relying on email chains, text messages, and testimony about conversations that happened years ago.

A well-drafted operating agreement, prepared at the time of formation, costs a fraction of what litigation costs if things go wrong.
