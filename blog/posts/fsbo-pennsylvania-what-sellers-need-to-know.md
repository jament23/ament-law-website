<div class="quick-answer">
<p>[For sale by owner (FSBO)](/practice-areas/for-sale-by-owner/) transactions are perfectly legal in Pennsylvania and can save a seller a significant amount in real estate commission. But Pennsylvania law imposes disclosure obligations, contract requirements, and settlement procedures that FSBO sellers must follow regardless of whether a real estate agent is involved. Here is what you need to know before you put up the sign.</p>
</div>

## Why Sellers Choose FSBO

The primary motivation for most FSBO sellers is straightforward: avoiding the listing agent's commission, which is typically 2.5% to 3% of the sale price. On a $350,000 home, that is $8,750 to $10,500 in savings. On a $500,000 home, the savings approach $15,000.

For sellers who are comfortable handling marketing and showing their home, and who understand the legal requirements, FSBO is a viable path. For those who are not — or who underestimate the complexity of the transaction — the savings can be offset by costly mistakes.

## Pennsylvania Seller Disclosure Requirements

Pennsylvania's Real Estate Seller Disclosure Law (68 Pa. C.S. § 7301 et seq.) requires residential sellers to complete a written disclosure statement disclosing all known material defects affecting the property. This is not optional, and it applies to FSBO transactions just as it applies to agent-assisted sales.

The required disclosure covers:

- Structural components — roof, walls, foundation, basement
- Mechanical systems — heating, cooling, plumbing, electrical
- Water supply and sewage systems
- Environmental hazards — lead paint, radon, asbestos, underground storage tanks
- Zoning and land use issues
- Homeowners association obligations and fees
- Any pending legal actions affecting the property

**The risk of inadequate disclosure:** A seller who fails to disclose a known material defect faces potential liability to the buyer after closing. Courts have consistently held that sellers cannot simply disclaim their way out of the disclosure obligation. If you know about a problem with your property, it must be disclosed.

Pennsylvania also requires sellers to provide a lead paint disclosure for homes built before 1978, consistent with federal law.

## The Agreement of Sale

The Agreement of Sale is the binding contract between buyer and seller. In agent-assisted transactions, agents typically use the standard form Agreement of Sale published by the Pennsylvania Association of Realtors. FSBO sellers are not required to use this form, but they need a legally enforceable contract that covers all material terms.

A proper Pennsylvania Agreement of Sale should address:

**Purchase price and deposit:** The amount of the earnest money deposit, how it is held, and the conditions under which it is refundable.

**Contingencies:** Most buyers will want a mortgage contingency, a home inspection contingency, and possibly an appraisal contingency. Each contingency should specify the deadline for satisfaction and what happens if the contingency is not met.

**Settlement date and possession:** When will settlement occur and when does the buyer take possession? These are not always the same date.

**Inclusions and exclusions:** What fixtures, appliances, and personal property are included in the sale, and what is excluded? Disputes over what was "included" are common in FSBO transactions where the contract is vague.

**As-is provisions:** If the property is being sold as-is, the contract should say so clearly — but even an as-is sale does not eliminate the seller's disclosure obligations for known defects.

## The Settlement Process

Settlement in Pennsylvania is typically conducted by a title company or attorney acting as settlement agent. The settlement agent performs the title search, issues title insurance, prepares the closing documents, handles the exchange of funds, and records the deed.

As a FSBO seller, you will need to select a settlement company. Your buyer's lender may have preferences, but the seller generally has the right to choose the settlement agent. Using an experienced settlement attorney — rather than a title company alone — provides an additional layer of legal oversight and someone who can advise you if issues arise at the closing table.

**Transfer taxes:** Pennsylvania imposes a realty transfer tax of 1% of the sale price at the state level. Local municipalities impose an additional transfer tax that varies by location — in most Western Pennsylvania municipalities, the total transfer tax is 2% of the sale price, typically split equally between buyer and seller.

**The deed:** The seller's attorney or the settlement agent prepares the deed transferring title to the buyer. The deed must be properly executed, acknowledged, and recorded with the county recorder of deeds.

## Where FSBO Sellers Most Commonly Run Into Trouble

In our experience handling FSBO settlements and assisting sellers who encounter problems mid-transaction, the most common issues are:

**Incomplete or inaccurate disclosure statements** that create post-closing liability.

**Contracts that don't address contingency deadlines**, leaving the seller in limbo when a buyer delays.

**Buyers who don't qualify for their mortgage** and a contract that doesn't clearly address what happens when the mortgage contingency deadline passes.

**Title issues** — existing liens, judgment creditors, boundary disputes, or chain of title problems — that weren't discovered until the title search was run. A seller who does not engage an attorney early may not know about these issues until they threaten to derail the closing.

## How an Attorney Can Help FSBO Sellers

Many FSBO sellers engage an attorney not to replace an agent, but to handle the legal aspects of the transaction — reviewing the Agreement of Sale, advising on disclosure obligations, and overseeing settlement. This provides meaningful protection at a fraction of the cost of a full listing commission.
