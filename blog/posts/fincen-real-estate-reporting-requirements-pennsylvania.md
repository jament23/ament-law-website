<div class="quick-answer">
<p>The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has finalized rules requiring professionals involved in certain residential real estate transactions to report beneficial ownership information to the federal government. If you are buying or selling real estate in Pennsylvania — particularly in an all-cash or entity transaction — here is what has changed and what it means for your closing.</p>

## Background: Why FinCEN Is Targeting Real Estate

Real estate has long been identified by federal regulators as a vehicle for money laundering. Unlike bank transactions, real estate purchases — particularly all-cash deals — historically required little transparency about who the true buyer was. A shell LLC could purchase property without any public disclosure of the individuals who actually owned or controlled it.

FinCEN addressed this in two phases. First, it issued Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) requiring title insurance companies to identify the beneficial owners behind certain high-value cash purchases in specific markets. Now, FinCEN has expanded reporting requirements through a finalized rule that applies more broadly to non-financed residential real estate transactions nationwide.

## What the New Rule Requires

Under FinCEN's residential real estate rule, certain professionals involved in real estate closings — including attorneys acting as settlement agents, title companies, and closing agents — are required to collect and report information about transactions that meet the rule's criteria. The reporting obligation is designed to identify the natural persons who are the true beneficial owners behind entity purchasers.

**Key elements of the rule include:**

The rule applies to transfers of residential real property to legal entities and trusts where the purchase is not financed through a regulated financial institution. Cash purchases and seller-financed transactions are the primary focus. Transactions involving individual purchasers buying in their own names with conventional financing are generally outside the rule's scope.

The reporting obligation falls on a "cascade" of professionals — if an attorney is acting as settlement agent, the obligation may fall on them. Title insurance companies and their agents are also covered. The covered professional must file a Real Estate Report with FinCEN identifying the beneficial owners of the purchasing entity.

## What This Means for Western Pennsylvania Transactions

For most conventional residential transactions in Westmoreland County, Allegheny County, and surrounding areas — where a buyer obtains a mortgage and purchases in their individual name — the new rule adds little friction to your closing. These transactions fall outside the primary scope of the reporting requirement.

However, if you are:

- Purchasing investment property through an LLC or other entity
- Completing an all-cash purchase through a trust or business entity
- Acting as a real estate investor using entity structures for multiple properties
- Involved in a seller-financed transaction to an entity

...then the new reporting requirements will affect your transaction. Your settlement agent will need to collect beneficial ownership information — meaning the names, addresses, dates of birth, and identification documents of the individuals who ultimately own or control the purchasing entity.

## The Corporate Transparency Act Connection

The FinCEN real estate rule operates alongside the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which separately requires most small businesses — including real estate holding LLCs — to file beneficial ownership information with FinCEN's database. While the CTA and the real estate rule are separate requirements, they reflect the same federal policy: greater transparency about who owns and controls business entities.

If you formed an LLC to hold real estate and have not addressed your CTA filing obligations, that is a separate compliance issue worth discussing with your attorney.

## Practical Steps for Buyers Using Entity Structures

If you are purchasing real estate through an LLC, trust, or other entity, the most important thing you can do is work with an experienced settlement attorney early in the process. Have your entity documents organized and be prepared to identify the beneficial owners of your entity before closing. Last-minute disclosure issues can delay settlement.
