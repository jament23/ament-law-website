<div class="quick-answer">
<p>Pennsylvania Medicaid covers nursing home care for eligible individuals — but the eligibility rules are strict, the asset limits are low, and the consequences of poor planning can be devastating. The good news is that legal planning strategies exist that can protect a significant portion of your family's assets, even when nursing home care is needed immediately. Here is what you need to know.</p>

## What Pennsylvania Medicaid Covers — and What It Costs

Medicaid (called Medical Assistance in Pennsylvania) is the primary payer for long-term nursing home care for individuals who have exhausted their private resources. Private nursing home care in Pennsylvania costs between $10,000 and $14,000 per month — a rate that can deplete a lifetime of savings in a matter of years.

Medicare, by contrast, covers only short-term skilled nursing care following a qualifying hospital stay — typically up to 100 days under limited circumstances. For the ongoing custodial care that most nursing home residents need, Medicaid is the only public benefit program available.

## The Basic Eligibility Rules

To qualify for Pennsylvania Medicaid for long-term care, an individual must meet both an income test and a resource (asset) test.

**Resource limit:** The applicant may retain only $2,400 in countable assets. This is an extremely low threshold — it means that for most individuals, virtually all savings, investments, and non-exempt assets must be spent down or transferred before Medicaid eligibility can be established.

**Exempt assets:** Not all assets count toward the resource limit. The applicant's primary residence is exempt (subject to estate recovery rules), one vehicle is exempt, personal property and household goods are exempt, and certain prepaid funeral and burial arrangements are exempt.

**The community spouse:** If the Medicaid applicant has a spouse living at home (the "community spouse"), the rules are more generous. The community spouse may retain the Community Spouse Resource Allowance — currently up to approximately $154,140 — plus the exempt assets. The community spouse also receives a Monthly Maintenance Needs Allowance to ensure adequate income for living expenses.

## The Five-Year Lookback Period

Pennsylvania Medicaid imposes a five-year lookback period on asset transfers. Any asset transferred for less than fair market value within five years of the Medicaid application is subject to a penalty period — a period of ineligibility calculated by dividing the value of the transferred assets by the average monthly cost of nursing home care.

This is the rule that catches most families off guard. A gift made to a child three years ago — even a modest one — can create a Medicaid penalty that delays benefits when care is urgently needed.

**What the lookback does not prohibit:** Transfers to a spouse are never penalized. Transfers to a disabled child are exempt. Transfers of a home to a caregiver child who lived in the home for at least two years and provided care that delayed nursing home placement are also exempt.

## Planning Strategies That Still Work

Despite the five-year lookback, there are planning strategies that can protect meaningful assets for your family.

**Spousal planning:** For married couples, the most powerful planning often involves maximizing what the community spouse can retain and structuring assets to take full advantage of the community spouse resource allowance and income rules.

**Exempt asset conversion:** Countable assets can sometimes be converted to exempt assets — paying off a mortgage, purchasing a vehicle, making home improvements, or prepaying funeral expenses are all legitimate spend-down strategies.

**Caregiver agreements:** A formal, written personal care agreement between the Medicaid applicant and a family caregiver can allow compensation to the caregiver for services rendered — provided the agreement was in place before the services were provided and reflects fair market compensation.

**Irrevocable Medicaid trusts:** With five or more years of lead time, assets can be transferred to an irrevocable trust that removes them from countable resources after the lookback period expires. This is one of the most effective long-term planning tools available — but it requires advance planning.

**Crisis planning:** Even when nursing home placement is imminent, options exist. An experienced elder law attorney can often preserve a significant portion of assets through a combination of annuities, promissory notes, spousal planning, and exempt asset conversion — even without the benefit of five years of lead time.

## The Importance of Acting Early

The single most important thing families can do is consult with an elder law attorney before a crisis occurs. Every year of lead time expands your options. Waiting until a nursing home admission is imminent limits what can be done — but does not eliminate the possibility of meaningful planning.

If you have an aging parent, a spouse with a chronic illness, or are planning for your own potential long-term care needs, an [elder law](/practice-areas/elder-law/) consultation is one of the most valuable steps you can take.
