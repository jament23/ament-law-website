faq:
  - question: "Why do professionals need a different approach to estate planning?"
    answer: "Professionals carry elevated liability exposure from their practice, often have complex compensation structures (deferred comp, partnership interests, buy-sell obligations), and frequently own both personal and practice-related assets that need distinct protection strategies. A generic estate plan doesn't account for any of this."
  - question: "Can my estate plan protect my personal assets from a malpractice claim?"
    answer: "Asset protection planning can create meaningful barriers between your professional liability and your personal wealth — but only if structures are in place before a claim arises. This may include irrevocable trusts, proper entity structuring, and strategic titling of assets. We coordinate these tools with your malpractice insurance to create layered protection."
  - question: "What happens to my practice if I become incapacitated or die unexpectedly?"
    answer: "Without a succession plan, your practice may need to be wound down under court supervision — which is disruptive for your clients, employees, and family. We build practice succession provisions into your estate plan and business documents so a designated successor or your partners can step in immediately."
  - question: "I'm a financial advisor — do you work with my clients on estate planning?"
    answer: "Yes. We regularly collaborate with financial advisors, CPAs, and insurance professionals on client estate plans. We handle the legal documents while you manage the financial strategy. We're happy to attend joint meetings and coordinate directly with your team."

<p class="lead-text">If you've spent years building a professional practice, your estate plan should reflect the complexity of your financial life — not just check a box. Professionals face planning challenges that generic estate plans don't address: practice succession, malpractice exposure, complex compensation, professional entity rules, and the intersection of business and personal assets.</p>

<p>At Ament Law Group, we work with physicians, attorneys, dentists, accountants, financial advisors, and other licensed professionals across Western Pennsylvania to build estate plans and business structures designed for how your professional life actually works.</p>

<h2>What Makes Professional Planning Different</h2>

<p>Most estate plans assume a straightforward financial picture — a house, some retirement accounts, maybe a life insurance policy. Professionals typically have a much more complex profile:</p>

<h3>Practice Ownership & Succession</h3>
<p>Your practice is likely one of your most valuable assets, but it's also one of the hardest to transfer. Unlike a rental property or investment account, a professional practice depends on relationships, licensure, and goodwill that can evaporate quickly without a plan. We build succession provisions directly into your estate plan and business documents — whether you're a solo practitioner who needs a wind-down plan, a partner in a group practice with buy-sell obligations, or a shareholder in a professional corporation governed by 15 Pa.C.S. § 2903.</p>

<h3>Asset Protection & Liability Exposure</h3>
<p>Professionals face elevated liability risk from malpractice claims, regulatory actions, and business disputes. While malpractice insurance is your first line of defense, it has limits — and claims can exceed coverage. Proper asset protection planning creates additional barriers between your professional liability and your personal wealth. This may include irrevocable trusts, strategic asset titling (including tenancy by the entireties for married couples under Pennsylvania law), entity structuring, and retirement account protections under federal and state exemption laws.</p>

<p>Critically, asset protection structures must be in place <em>before</em> a claim arises. Transfers made after a claim or threatened claim can be unwound as fraudulent transfers under Pennsylvania's Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (12 Pa.C.S. § 5101 et seq.). We help you plan proactively, not reactively.</p>

<h3>Complex Compensation & Benefits</h3>
<p>Professional compensation often goes well beyond a W-2 salary. Deferred compensation arrangements, partnership draws, profit-sharing plans, stock options, restricted equity, and employer-provided benefits each create planning considerations that must be coordinated with your estate plan. A single overlooked beneficiary designation on a deferred comp plan can override your entire will or trust — and these designations change when you change employers, practices, or partnerships.</p>

<h3>Professional Entity Requirements</h3>
<p>Pennsylvania imposes specific requirements on professional entities. Professional corporations (15 Pa.C.S. § 2903), professional LLCs, and professional associations each have restrictions on who can hold ownership interests and what happens when an owner dies, becomes incapacitated, or loses their license. Your entity documents and your estate plan must be coordinated to comply with these rules — otherwise, your family may be forced to liquidate your interest under unfavorable terms.</p>

<h2>Planning by Profession</h2>

<h3>Physicians & Dentists</h3>
<p>Medical and dental professionals face malpractice exposure that can extend years beyond treatment through Pennsylvania's statute of limitations and discovery rules. We address this through layered asset protection — irrevocable trusts, proper entity structuring, and coordination with your malpractice tail coverage. For practice owners, we draft buy-sell agreements that account for the unique valuation challenges of medical and dental practices, including accounts receivable, patient goodwill, and equipment depreciation. For employed physicians, we focus on coordinating hospital system benefits, deferred compensation, and retirement plans with the personal estate plan.</p>

<h3>Attorneys</h3>
<p>Attorneys have unique succession challenges — client files are confidential, trust accounts must be properly wound down, and the Rules of Professional Conduct impose specific obligations when a lawyer dies or becomes incapacitated. We build plans that designate a successor attorney or authorized representative to manage the wind-down, protect client interests, and preserve the value of the practice for your family. We also address the ethical obligations under Pa.R.P.C. 1.17 regarding the sale of a law practice.</p>

<h3>Accountants & Financial Advisors</h3>
<p>CPAs and financial advisors often have the most complex personal financial profiles of any professional — multiple retirement account types, investment portfolios, deferred compensation, and business interests that they understand better than most. What they often lack is the legal architecture to protect and transfer it all. We build the legal framework — trusts, entity documents, powers of attorney, and succession plans — that complements the financial strategy you already have in place.</p>

<p>We also work directly with financial advisors and CPAs who refer their clients to us for estate planning. We coordinate on beneficiary designations, trust funding, and tax-efficient transfer strategies.

<h2>What a Professional Estate Plan Includes</h2>

<p>Every plan is tailored to the individual, but professional estate plans typically address:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Last Will and Testament</strong> — with provisions that account for professional assets, practice interests, and any restrictions on transfer</li>
    <li><strong>Revocable Living Trust</strong> — when appropriate for probate avoidance, privacy, or management of assets during incapacity</li>
    <li><strong>Financial Power of Attorney</strong> — drafted under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601 with specific authority to manage practice finances, sign tax returns, and handle business operations</li>
    <li><strong>Healthcare Power of Attorney & Living Will</strong> — including HIPAA authorizations</li>
    <li><strong>Practice Succession Plan</strong> — integrated with buy-sell agreements, partnership documents, or solo practitioner wind-down procedures</li>
    <li><strong>Asset Protection Review</strong> — entity structuring, asset titling, and trust strategies to shield personal wealth from professional liability</li>
    <li><strong>Beneficiary Designation Audit</strong> — a complete review of every retirement account, life insurance policy, deferred comp plan, and investment account to ensure alignment with the overall plan</li>
    <li><strong>Buy-Sell Agreement</strong> — for practice owners with partners, coordinated with life insurance funding and the estate plan</li>
</ul>

<h2>For Advisors: A Collaborative Approach</h2>

<p>If you're a financial advisor, CPA, or insurance professional, we'd welcome the opportunity to work with your clients. We handle the legal documents while you manage the financial strategy — and we coordinate directly with you to make sure everything fits together. We're happy to attend joint client meetings, provide educational presentations for your clients, or simply be available when your clients need estate planning counsel.</p>
