                <p class="lead-text">Estate planning doesn't have to be confusing or intimidating. In this free seminar, our attorneys break down how Pennsylvania law actually works — in plain language, with real examples — so you can make informed decisions about protecting your family.</p>

                <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wills vs. Trusts</strong> — When each makes sense under Pennsylvania law, what they cost, and what happens if you have neither</li>
                    <li><strong>Powers of Attorney</strong> — Why every adult needs financial and healthcare powers of attorney, and what happens when you don't have them (hint: guardianship court)</li>
                    <li><strong>Probate in Pennsylvania</strong> — How it actually works, what it actually costs, and why the horror stories you've heard probably came from other states</li>
                    <li><strong>Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax</strong> — The rates (0%, 4.5%, 12%, 15%), who pays, and strategies to minimize the tax legally</li>
                    <li><strong>Beneficiary Designations</strong> — The most overlooked part of any estate plan, and how a single outdated beneficiary form can override your entire will</li>
                    <li><strong>Common Mistakes</strong> — The planning gaps we see most often in our practice, and how to avoid them</li>
                    <li><strong>Protecting Your Family</strong> — Blended families, minor children, aging parents, special needs beneficiaries, and business owners each have unique considerations</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What This Seminar Is Not</h2>

                <p>This is not a sales presentation. We won't pressure you to sign up for anything. We won't tell you that everyone needs a trust. We won't use scare tactics about probate. We're attorneys — our job is to counsel, not to sell. You'll leave with a better understanding of your options and the confidence to take the next step on your own terms.</p>

                <p>If you've attended a <a href="/seminar/">high-pressure trust seminar</a> and want to hear a different perspective, this is a good place to start.</p>
