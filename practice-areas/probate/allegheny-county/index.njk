          <p>Ament Law Group regularly handles probate and estate administration matters in Allegheny County. We file with the <strong>Allegheny County Department of Court Records — Wills/Orphans' Court Division</strong>, know the local process, and serve families across the county from our Murrysville office — just over the county line on Route 22.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Allegheny County Probate — What to Expect</h2>

        <p>When a loved one passes away in Allegheny County, the estate administration process runs through the Department of Court Records, Wills/Orphans' Court Division, located at 436 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219. This office handles the qualification of executors and administrators, acceptance of inventories, and oversight of formal accountings when required.</p>

        <p>Probate in Pennsylvania is not always as complicated or as expensive as people expect — but it does require filing in the right order, meeting publication deadlines, and handling Pennsylvania inheritance tax correctly. An attorney with local experience keeps the process on track and protects the executor from personal liability for missteps.</p>

              <h3>Strategy &amp; Intake</h3>
              <p>We review the will, map the assets, assess liquidity for inheritance tax, and lay out a clear plan with disclosed fees before any work begins.</p>

              <p>We file the petition with the Allegheny County Department of Court Records to qualify the executor or administrator. We prepare all filings and accompany you to any required hearings.</p>

              <h3>Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax</h3>
              <p>Pennsylvania's inheritance tax applies to most estate assets regardless of where they are held. We prepare the REV-1500 return, coordinate with your financial advisors and accountant, and advise on the 5% early-payment discount available within three months of death.</p>

              <h3>Account, Waivers &amp; Distribution</h3>
              <p>We prepare the informal family settlement agreement or coordinate a formal audit if required. Once all obligations are satisfied, we guide the final distributions and formally close the estate.</p>

        <h2>Do You Need Probate?</h2>

        <p>Not all assets require probate. Joint accounts with right of survivorship, accounts with designated beneficiaries (POD, TOD, IRAs, 401(k)s), and assets held in a funded revocable trust typically pass outside the probate process.</p>

        <p>Assets titled solely in the decedent's name — including Allegheny County real estate — generally do require probate. If the deceased owned a home in Fox Chapel, Sewickley, Mt. Lebanon, or anywhere else in Allegheny County, that property will need to pass through the estate before it can be transferred or sold.</p>

        <p>We evaluate the full estate picture during your initial consultation and identify the most efficient path forward, including whether a small estate procedure is available.</p>

        <h2>Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Rates</h2>

        <p>Pennsylvania's inheritance tax is assessed against most assets that transfer at death, including real estate, bank accounts, investments, and personal property. Current rates:</p>

        <div class="comparison-table">
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Beneficiary</th>
                <th>Tax Rate</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Surviving spouse</td>
                <td>0%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Children, grandchildren, parents</td>
                <td>4.5%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Siblings</td>
                <td>12%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>All other individuals</td>
                <td>15%</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>The tax is due within nine months of the date of death. Paying within three months of death earns a 5% discount on the amount paid — a real saving on estates with significant value.</p>

        <h2>Small Estate Options in Pennsylvania</h2>

        <p>Pennsylvania allows simplified procedures for smaller estates, including the use of an affidavit process for certain assets that avoids full probate administration. Eligibility depends on the nature and value of the assets. We assess this during your consultation and pursue the simplest available path.</p>

        <h2>Remote and Out-of-State Executors</h2>

        <p>Allegheny County estates frequently involve executors who live outside Pennsylvania — or even outside the country. Pennsylvania permits out-of-state executors, typically with a co-executor who is a Pennsylvania resident or a surety bond. We handle all local filings and coordinate document execution remotely, minimizing the need for multiple trips to Pittsburgh or Greensburg.</p>

        <h2>Communities We Serve in Allegheny County</h2>

        <p>We serve families throughout Allegheny County, including Pittsburgh, Fox Chapel, O'Hara Township, Sewickley, Edgeworth, Leetsdale, Upper St. Clair, Mt. Lebanon, Bethel Park, Peters Township, Wexford, Bradford Woods, Pine-Richland, Monroeville, Forest Hills, and communities throughout the county. Both in-office and remote consultations are available.</p>
