          <p>Ament Law Group is based in Murrysville — at the heart of Westmoreland County. We handle probate and estate administration matters regularly at the Westmoreland County Courthouse in Greensburg, and we know what families need to navigate this process efficiently, correctly, and without surprise costs.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Westmoreland County Probate — What to Expect</h2>

        <p>Probate in Pennsylvania is the legal process for administering a deceased person's estate — gathering assets, notifying creditors, paying taxes, and distributing property to heirs. In Westmoreland County, estate matters are handled through the <strong>Register of Wills and the Orphans' Court Division</strong> at the Westmoreland County Courthouse, 2 North Main Street, Greensburg, PA 15601.</p>

        <p>Every estate is different. Some resolve in a few months. Others — involving real estate sales, tax elections, or contested distributions — take longer. What matters is having an attorney who handles the details systematically, keeps you informed, and bills you fairly for the work done.</p>

        <h2>The Probate Process in Westmoreland County</h2>

        <div class="step-guide">
          <div class="step">
            <div class="step-number">1</div>
            <div class="step-content">
              <h3>Strategy &amp; Intake</h3>
              <p>We review the will, identify assets and debts, assess liquidity for tax obligations, and map a plan from day one. No surprises — you know the scope and the fee before we begin.</p>
            </div>

          <div class="step">

            <div class="step-content">
              <h3>Open the Estate</h3>
              <p>We file the petition with the Westmoreland County Register of Wills to qualify the executor or administrator. We prepare all filings and attend any required hearings with you.</p>

            <div class="step-content">
              <h3>Notices &amp; Inventory</h3>
              <p>Pennsylvania law requires publication of notice to creditors and formal notice to heirs. We handle publication, prepare the Inventory, and manage creditor claims during the claims period.</p>
            </div>

              <h3>Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax</h3>
              <p>Pennsylvania imposes inheritance tax on most estate assets. Rates depend on the beneficiary's relationship to the decedent. We prepare the return, coordinate with your accountant if needed, and advise on early-payment discounts (5% discount if paid within 3 months of death).</p>
            </div>
          </div>

            <div class="step-content">
              <h3>Account, Waivers &amp; Distribution</h3>
              <p>We prepare the informal account or coordinate an audit if required, obtain beneficiary consents, and guide final asset distributions. We close the estate with the Register of Wills once all obligations are satisfied.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Do You Need Probate?</h2>

        <p>Not every asset requires probate. Assets that pass automatically — joint accounts with survivorship rights, accounts with named beneficiaries (POD/TOD, IRAs, 401(k)s), and assets in a funded trust — generally do not go through the probate process.</p>

        <p>Assets titled solely in the decedent's name, including Pennsylvania real estate, typically do require probate. We evaluate the full picture during your initial consultation and advise on the most efficient path forward.</p>

        <h2>Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Rates</h2>

        <p>Pennsylvania's inheritance tax applies to transfers of most estate assets. Current rates:</p>

        <div class="comparison-table">
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Beneficiary</th>
                <th>Tax Rate</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Surviving spouse</td>
                <td>0%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Children, grandchildren, parents</td>
                <td>4.5%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Siblings</td>
                <td>12%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>All other individuals</td>
                <td>15%</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>The tax is due within nine months of the date of death. Paying within three months earns a 5% discount on the amount paid — a meaningful savings on larger estates.</p>

        <h2>Small Estate Options</h2>

        <p>Pennsylvania provides streamlined options for modest estates, including the ability to use a <strong>small estate affidavit</strong> to transfer certain assets without full probate administration. We assess eligibility during your consultation and prepare the appropriate filings if a simplified path is available.</p>

        <h2>Out-of-State Executor? No Problem.</h2>

        <p>Pennsylvania permits out-of-state executors with a Pennsylvania resident co-executor or surety bond. We regularly work with families whose executor lives outside the Commonwealth, handling all local filings and coordinating remote signing through e-signature platforms.</p>

        <h2>Communities We Serve in Westmoreland County</h2>

Pleasant, and New Kensington. We offer in-office and remote consultations.</p>
