<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Business formation in Pennsylvania</strong> requires filing the appropriate documents with the Pennsylvania Department of State. The most common entity types are Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), which are formed by filing a Certificate of Organization, and corporations, formed by filing Articles of Incorporation. Pennsylvania LLCs offer personal liability protection, pass-through taxation, and flexible management structures. An operating agreement, while not filed with the state, is essential for defining member rights, profit distribution, and management authority.</p>
