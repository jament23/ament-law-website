<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Business formation</strong> is the legal process of establishing a business entity &mdash; such as an LLC, corporation, or partnership &mdash; with the Pennsylvania Department of State. Choosing the right entity structure affects your personal liability, tax obligations, management flexibility, and ability to raise capital. Our attorneys help entrepreneurs and business owners select and form the entity that best fits their goals.</p>
</div>

<h2>Choosing the Right Business Entity</h2>
<p>One of the most important decisions you will make as a business owner is selecting the right legal entity. Each structure offers different advantages in terms of liability protection, tax treatment, and operational flexibility. The most common options in Pennsylvania include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</strong> &mdash; The most popular choice for small businesses, an LLC provides personal liability protection while offering flexibility in management and taxation. Pennsylvania LLCs are governed by the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (15 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8811 et seq.).</li>
    <li><strong>Corporation (C-Corp or S-Corp)</strong> &mdash; Corporations offer the strongest liability protection and are well-suited for businesses planning to seek investors or issue stock. An S-Corp election allows profits to pass through to shareholders, avoiding double taxation.</li>
    <li><strong>General and Limited Partnerships</strong> &mdash; Partnerships are appropriate when two or more individuals want to operate a business together. Limited partnerships offer liability protection for limited partners while general partners retain management control.</li>
    <li><strong>Sole Proprietorship</strong> &mdash; The simplest structure, but offers no liability protection. We generally advise clients to form an LLC even for single-member businesses to separate personal and business assets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Formation Process</h2>
<p>Forming a business entity involves more than filing paperwork with the state. Our business formation services include advising on entity selection based on your specific goals, industry, and tax situation, preparing and filing the Articles of Organization (LLC) or Articles of Incorporation (corporation) with the Pennsylvania Department of State, drafting an operating agreement (LLC) or bylaws and shareholder agreement (corporation) that govern the internal operations of the business, obtaining your federal EIN from the IRS, advising on Pennsylvania business licensing and registration requirements, and coordinating with your accountant on tax elections including S-Corp status.</p>

<h2>Why an Operating Agreement Matters</h2>
<p>If you form an LLC without an operating agreement, Pennsylvania's default statutory rules will govern your business. These defaults may not reflect your intentions regarding profit sharing, decision-making authority, what happens if a member wants to leave, or how disputes are resolved. A well-drafted operating agreement customizes these rules to fit your business and prevents costly disputes down the road.</p>
<p>For corporations, a shareholder agreement and bylaws serve a similar purpose &mdash; defining voting rights, dividend policies, restrictions on share transfers, and buy-sell provisions in the event of a shareholder's death, disability, or departure.</p>

<h2>Ongoing Compliance</h2>
<p>Pennsylvania requires business entities to maintain their registration with the Department of State, file annual reports when applicable, and comply with local business privilege taxes and registration requirements. Failure to maintain compliance can result in administrative dissolution of your entity and loss of liability protection. We help business owners stay current with these obligations and ensure their entity remains in good standing.</p>
<h2>Common Questions About Business Formation in Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Clients frequently ask whether they need an attorney to form an LLC. While it is possible to file formation documents yourself through the Pennsylvania Department of State, the filing itself is only one piece of the process. Without a properly drafted operating agreement, your LLC will be governed by Pennsylvania's default statutory rules — which may not reflect your intentions regarding profit sharing, management authority, or what happens if a member leaves. An attorney ensures that your entity is structured correctly from the start, with governing documents that protect your interests and prevent future disputes.</p>
<p>We also advise clients on the tax implications of different entity structures. For example, an LLC can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietorship, partnership, S-corporation, or C-corporation. The right election depends on your income level, whether you have employees, your plans for growth, and your overall tax situation. We coordinate with your accountant to ensure the entity structure and tax elections work together efficiently.</p>
<p>For businesses with multiple owners, we strongly recommend addressing exit strategies during the formation process. A well-drafted buy-sell agreement or operating agreement provision that covers death, disability, retirement, or voluntary departure of an owner prevents disputes and protects the remaining owners and the business itself.</p>

<h2>Situations We Handle</h2>
<p>Our business formation practice addresses the full range of scenarios that new and growing businesses encounter in Western Pennsylvania:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Two partners launching a contracting company:</strong> We form a multi-member LLC with an operating agreement that defines each partner's capital contributions, profit splits, management responsibilities, and a buyout process if one partner wants to exit — preventing the disputes that sink partnerships without written agreements.</li>
    <li><strong>Side business going full-time:</strong> A freelancer or sole proprietor ready to commit full-time needs liability protection and a tax-efficient structure. We evaluate whether a single-member LLC with an S-Corp tax election makes sense based on their projected income and self-employment tax exposure.</li>
    <li><strong>Family business planning for the next generation:</strong> When parents want to bring children into an established business, we restructure the entity to create ownership classes, establish governance rules, and build succession pathways that keep the business running smoothly through a generational transition.</li>
    <li><strong>Real estate investor setting up a holding company:</strong> Investors purchasing multiple properties often benefit from a parent LLC with separate entities for each property, limiting liability exposure across the portfolio while maintaining manageable administration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How much does it cost to form an LLC in Pennsylvania?</h3>
    <p>The Pennsylvania Department of State charges a $125 filing fee for LLC formation. Our legal fees cover the entity selection consultation, preparation and filing of formation documents, EIN registration, and drafting a custom operating agreement. We provide a flat-rate quote at the beginning of the engagement so you know the total cost upfront.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>LLC or S-Corp — which is better?</h3>
    <p>An LLC and an S-Corp are not mutually exclusive. An LLC can elect to be taxed as an S-Corp, giving you both the liability protection and operational flexibility of an LLC with the potential payroll tax savings of an S-Corp. This election generally makes sense once your business is consistently earning above a certain income threshold. We work with your accountant to determine the right structure for your situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What happens if I don't have an operating agreement?</h3>
    <p>Pennsylvania's default rules under the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act will govern your LLC. For multi-member LLCs, this means equal profit sharing regardless of capital contributions, management decisions by majority vote, and no restrictions on member transfers. For single-member LLCs, the absence of an operating agreement can weaken your liability protection by making it harder to demonstrate that the LLC is a separate entity from you personally.</p>
