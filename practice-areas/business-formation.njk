<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Business formation</strong> is the legal process of establishing a business entity &mdash; such as an LLC, corporation, or partnership &mdash; with the Pennsylvania Department of State. Choosing the right entity structure affects your personal liability, tax obligations, management flexibility, and ability to raise capital. Our attorneys help entrepreneurs and business owners select and form the entity that best fits their goals.</p>
</div>

<h2>Choosing the Right Business Entity</h2>
<p>One of the most important decisions you will make as a business owner is selecting the right legal entity. Each structure offers different advantages in terms of liability protection, tax treatment, and operational flexibility. The most common options in Pennsylvania include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</strong> &mdash; The most popular choice for small businesses, an LLC provides personal liability protection while offering flexibility in management and taxation. Pennsylvania LLCs are governed by the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (15 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8811 et seq.).</li>
    <li><strong>Corporation (C-Corp or S-Corp)</strong> &mdash; Corporations offer the strongest liability protection and are well-suited for businesses planning to seek investors or issue stock. An S-Corp election allows profits to pass through to shareholders, avoiding double taxation.</li>
    <li><strong>General and Limited Partnerships</strong> &mdash; Partnerships are appropriate when two or more individuals want to operate a business together. Limited partnerships offer liability protection for limited partners while general partners retain management control.</li>
    <li><strong>Sole Proprietorship</strong> &mdash; The simplest structure, but offers no liability protection. We generally advise clients to form an LLC even for single-member businesses to separate personal and business assets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Formation Process</h2>
<p>Forming a business entity involves more than filing paperwork with the state. Our business formation services include advising on entity selection based on your specific goals, industry, and tax situation, preparing and filing the Articles of Organization (LLC) or Articles of Incorporation (corporation) with the Pennsylvania Department of State, drafting an operating agreement (LLC) or bylaws and shareholder agreement (corporation) that govern the internal operations of the business, obtaining your federal EIN from the IRS, advising on Pennsylvania business licensing and registration requirements, and coordinating with your accountant on tax elections including S-Corp status.</p>

<h2>Why an Operating Agreement Matters</h2>
<p>If you form an LLC without an operating agreement, Pennsylvania's default statutory rules will govern your business. These defaults may not reflect your intentions regarding profit sharing, decision-making authority, what happens if a member wants to leave, or how disputes are resolved. A well-drafted operating agreement customizes these rules to fit your business and prevents costly disputes down the road.</p>
<p>For corporations, a shareholder agreement and bylaws serve a similar purpose &mdash; defining voting rights, dividend policies, restrictions on share transfers, and buy-sell provisions in the event of a shareholder's death, disability, or departure.</p>

<h2>Ongoing Compliance</h2>
<p>Pennsylvania requires business entities to maintain their registration with the Department of State, file annual reports when applicable, and comply with local business privilege taxes and registration requirements. Failure to maintain compliance can result in administrative dissolution of your entity and loss of liability protection. We help business owners stay current with these obligations and ensure their entity remains in good standing.</p>
