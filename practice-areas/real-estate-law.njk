<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Real estate settlement</strong> is the legal process of transferring ownership of property from seller to buyer in Pennsylvania. A licensed title agent or attorney conducts the title search, prepares closing documents, handles the exchange of funds, and records the deed with the county. At Ament Law Group, our attorneys are licensed Pennsylvania title insurance agents who handle every aspect of settlement.</p>
</div>

<h2>What Happens at a Real Estate Settlement?</h2>
<p>Settlement &mdash; also called closing &mdash; is the final step in a real estate transaction. It is the meeting where the buyer signs the mortgage documents, the seller signs the deed, funds are distributed, and ownership officially transfers. In Pennsylvania, settlement is typically conducted by a title company or an attorney acting as settlement agent.</p>
<p>At Ament Law Group, our attorneys personally conduct every settlement. Unlike large title companies where you may never speak to an attorney, our clients work directly with a licensed attorney who reviews every document, explains every line item on the settlement statement, and ensures the transaction closes correctly. This level of attention helps prevent costly errors and gives both buyers and sellers confidence in the process.</p>

<h2>Our Settlement Services</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Title Search and Examination</strong> &mdash; We conduct a thorough search of county records to verify that the seller has clear title to the property and to identify any liens, encumbrances, judgments, or outstanding mortgages that must be resolved before closing.</li>
    <li><strong>Title Insurance</strong> &mdash; We issue both owner's and lender's title insurance policies to protect against defects in title that may not be discoverable through a standard search, including forgery, undisclosed heirs, and recording errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Document Preparation</strong> &mdash; We prepare all closing documents including the deed, settlement statement, transfer tax certifications, and any required affidavits or declarations.</li>
    <li><strong>Escrow and Fund Disbursement</strong> &mdash; We hold all funds in a secure escrow account and disburse them at closing in accordance with the settlement statement, including payoff of the seller's existing mortgage, real estate commissions, and transfer taxes.</li>
    <li><strong>Recording and Post-Closing</strong> &mdash; After settlement, we record the deed and mortgage with the county recorder of deeds and ensure that all post-closing obligations are completed, including final title policy issuance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pennsylvania Transfer Taxes</h2>
<p>Pennsylvania imposes a real estate transfer tax of 1% at the state level. Most municipalities impose an additional 1% local transfer tax, bringing the total to 2% in most areas of Westmoreland County. The transfer tax is typically split equally between the buyer and seller unless the agreement of sale provides otherwise. Certain transfers are exempt from transfer tax, including transfers between spouses, transfers to or from certain trusts, and transfers pursuant to a divorce decree. Our attorneys review every transaction for applicable exemptions to minimize costs for our clients.</p>

<h2>Why Choose an Attorney for Settlement?</h2>
<p>While Pennsylvania does not require an attorney at closing, having one provides significant advantages. An attorney can identify and resolve title issues that a title company may overlook, explain the legal implications of the documents you are signing, ensure that the terms of your agreement of sale are properly reflected in the closing documents, and protect your interests if unexpected issues arise at the settlement table. For one of the largest financial transactions of your life, having an experienced attorney at your side is a wise investment.</p>
