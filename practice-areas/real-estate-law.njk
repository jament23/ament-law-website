<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Real estate closings in Pennsylvania</strong> are typically handled by a settlement agent — either a title company or an attorney acting as a licensed title insurance agent. Unlike many states, Pennsylvania does not require attorney involvement at closing, but having an attorney conduct the settlement provides an additional layer of legal protection. At Ament Law Group, our attorneys are licensed title insurance agents through Chicago Title and First American, allowing us to issue title insurance policies, conduct title searches, and handle all aspects of the closing while providing legal counsel throughout the transaction.</p>

<h2>Attorney-Run Real Estate Settlements</h2>
<p>Our law firm provides comprehensive real estate settlement services, including closings and title insurance, to ensure a smooth and secure property transfer for our clients. As licensed title agents and experienced attorneys, we bring a unique combination of legal expertise and meticulous attention to detail to every transaction.</p>
<p>Real estate closings are inherently complex, requiring expert navigation. Our attorneys, in their capacity as licensed title agents, personally review each title to identify and address potential pitfalls before they become problems.</p>
<h2>Our Settlement Services</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Title Examination</strong> — Scrutinizing public records, verifying legal ownership, and ensuring properties are free from liens, encumbrances, and other complications.</li>
    <li><strong>Document Preparation & Review</strong> — Drafting and reviewing purchase agreements, deeds, and all closing documents for accuracy and compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Closing Coordination</strong> — Managing all aspects of the settlement process, coordinating with buyers, sellers, lenders, and real estate agents.</li>
    <li><strong>Title Insurance</strong> — Issuing title insurance through Chicago Title and First American to protect against unforeseen title disputes post-closing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Choose an Attorney-Run Settlement Company?</h2>
<p>While some non-attorney-run settlement companies may offer cost savings, they often lack the legal knowledge and experience needed for complex transactions. Choosing an attorney-run settlement company ensures your settlement is managed efficiently and effectively, with all legal obligations met and any potential issues promptly addressed.</p>
<p>As a buyer, you have the right to choose the title company that best fits your needs. Our attorneys are available to review any forms you sign and offer guidance on the best options for your situation.</p>
