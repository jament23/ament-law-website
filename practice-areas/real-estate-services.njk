<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Real estate legal services</strong> extend beyond buying and selling property. Our attorneys handle lease drafting and review, landlord-tenant matters, property tax assessment appeals, boundary and easement disputes, and legal guidance for real estate investors. Whether you own a single rental property or a growing portfolio, we provide the legal support your real estate interests require.</p>
</div>

<h2>Lease Drafting and Review</h2>
<p>A well-drafted lease is the foundation of a successful landlord-tenant relationship. Pennsylvania's Landlord and Tenant Act (68 P.S. &sect; 250.101 et seq.) governs residential leases and imposes specific requirements regarding security deposits, habitability, notice periods, and eviction procedures. Our attorneys draft residential and commercial leases that comply with Pennsylvania law, clearly define the rights and obligations of both parties, and include provisions that protect your investment.</p>
<p>We also review existing leases for clients who are acquiring rental property or renegotiating terms with tenants. Common issues we address include security deposit handling and return requirements, maintenance and repair responsibilities, lease renewal and termination provisions, pet policies and property use restrictions, late fees, penalties, and remedies for default, and compliance with local housing codes and ordinances.</p>

<h2>Landlord-Tenant Matters</h2>
<p>Disputes between landlords and tenants are an inevitable part of owning rental property. Our attorneys represent landlords in lease enforcement, non-payment proceedings, and evictions in the magisterial district courts throughout Westmoreland and Allegheny Counties. We also advise landlords on proper notice requirements, security deposit disputes, property damage claims, and compliance with fair housing laws.</p>
<p>When disputes can be resolved without litigation, we pursue negotiated solutions that minimize cost and disruption. When court action is necessary, we move efficiently to protect your property rights and rental income.</p>

<h2>Property Tax Assessment Appeals</h2>
<p>If your property is over-assessed, you may be paying more in property taxes than you should. In Westmoreland County, property assessments are based on the county's base-year valuation, and the common level ratio (CLR) published annually by the State Tax Equalization Board determines the relationship between assessed value and fair market value. Our attorneys evaluate whether your assessment is accurate, gather supporting evidence including comparable sales data, and represent you before the county Board of Assessment Appeals.</p>
<p>A successful appeal can reduce your property tax burden for years to come, making it a worthwhile investment for homeowners, commercial property owners, and real estate investors alike.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Investment Guidance</h2>
<p>For clients who invest in real estate, we provide legal guidance on entity structuring for rental properties, acquisition and disposition of investment properties, 1031 like-kind exchange coordination, financing and lender negotiations, and property management agreements. We work closely with our clients' accountants and financial advisors to ensure that every real estate transaction is structured to maximize tax efficiency and minimize legal exposure.</p>

<h2>Boundary and Easement Disputes</h2>
<p>Disputes over property boundaries, shared driveways, fencing, and easements are common in Western Pennsylvania. These issues can affect your ability to use, improve, or sell your property. Our attorneys review surveys, deeds, and title records to determine your rights, and work to resolve boundary and easement disputes through negotiation or, when necessary, through appropriate legal action.</p>

<h2>Situations We Handle</h2>
<p>Our real estate legal practice covers a wide range of scenarios that property owners encounter across Westmoreland, Allegheny, and surrounding counties:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Landlord facing chronic non-payment:</strong> We guide landlords through Pennsylvania's eviction process, from the required notice under 68 P.S. § 250.501 through filing a complaint in magisterial district court, ensuring procedural compliance at every stage so the landlord's case holds up and possession is restored efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Over-assessed commercial property:</strong> A business owner discovers that their Westmoreland County property assessment exceeds fair market value by tens of thousands of dollars. We compile comparable sales data, retain an appraiser when necessary, and present the case to the Board of Assessment Appeals — often producing annual tax savings that far exceed our fees.</li>
    <li><strong>Investor structuring a rental portfolio:</strong> We advise real estate investors on whether to hold properties individually, in an LLC, or through a series LLC, weighing liability protection, tax treatment, financing implications, and the administrative requirements of each approach under Pennsylvania's Association Transactions Act (15 Pa.C.S. § 300 et seq.).</li>
    <li><strong>Neighbors disputing a shared driveway:</strong> When a neighbor blocks access to a shared driveway or challenges a long-standing easement, we research the deed chain, locate recorded easement agreements, and negotiate a resolution — or pursue a quiet title action if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Protecting Your Real Estate Investment</h2>
<p>Real estate is often a family's largest asset, and legal issues affecting your property can have significant financial consequences. Whether you are dealing with a boundary dispute, an inaccurate tax assessment, a problematic tenant, or a complex title issue, the stakes are high enough to warrant experienced legal counsel. Our attorneys have represented property owners, landlords, developers, and investors throughout Westmoreland and Allegheny Counties and understand the local regulations, tax structures, and court procedures that affect Western Pennsylvania real estate.</p>

<p>We also assist clients with deed transfers within families, including transfers between spouses, transfers to trusts as part of estate planning, and transfers to LLCs for asset protection purposes. These transactions must be handled carefully to avoid triggering unnecessary transfer taxes under Pennsylvania's realty transfer tax law (72 P.S. § 8102-C) and to ensure that the chain of title remains clear. Our experience with both real estate and estate planning allows us to coordinate these transfers efficiently and correctly.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How much does a property tax assessment appeal cost?</h3>
    <p>Our fees for assessment appeals vary based on the complexity of the case and whether an appraisal is needed. Many homeowners find that the first-year tax savings alone exceed the cost of the appeal, with additional savings continuing for years. We are happy to evaluate your assessment during an initial consultation and give you an honest opinion about whether an appeal is likely to succeed.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What can I do if my tenant is not paying rent?</h3>
    <p>Pennsylvania law requires that landlords follow specific procedures before evicting a tenant for non-payment. You must serve a written notice to quit, giving the tenant ten days (for leases of one year or more) or fifteen days (for verbal or at-will tenancies) to vacate. If the tenant does not leave, you can file a landlord-tenant complaint in the local magisterial district court. Self-help evictions — such as changing locks or shutting off utilities — are illegal and can expose you to liability.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Should I hold rental property in an LLC?</h3>
    <p>In most cases, holding rental property in a properly maintained LLC provides meaningful liability protection, separating your personal assets from risks associated with the property. However, an LLC adds administrative requirements and may affect your ability to obtain certain types of financing. We help investors weigh the pros and cons based on their specific portfolio, risk profile, and long-term goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How do I resolve a boundary dispute with my neighbor?</h3>
    <p>Start by locating your deed and any available surveys. If the boundary is unclear, a licensed surveyor can establish the legal boundary based on the deed description. Many boundary disputes can be resolved through a neighborly conversation backed by survey evidence. If negotiation fails, our attorneys can pursue legal remedies including a declaratory judgment action to establish the boundary or an ejectment action if your neighbor is encroaching on your land.</p>
