<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Real estate legal services</strong> extend well beyond buying and selling property. Our attorneys handle deed transfers, commercial and residential lease drafting, landlord-tenant disputes, property tax assessment appeals, boundary and easement issues, and legal guidance for real estate investors. Whether you are transferring a family home into a trust, negotiating a commercial lease, or managing a rental portfolio, we provide the legal support your real estate interests require.</p>
</div>

<h2>Deed Transfers</h2>
<p>Deed transfers are one of the most common reasons clients contact our office — and one of the easiest things to get wrong. A deed is the legal instrument that conveys ownership of real property, and Pennsylvania law recognizes several types, each offering different levels of protection to the new owner.</p>
<p>A <strong>General Warranty Deed</strong> provides the highest level of protection, with the seller guaranteeing clear title free of encumbrances for the entire chain of ownership. A <strong>Special Warranty Deed</strong> limits the seller's guarantee to issues that arose during their ownership period — common in estate and trust transfers. A <strong>Quitclaim Deed</strong> transfers whatever interest the grantor has with no warranties at all, typically used between family members or to clear title defects.</p>
<p>We handle deed transfers in a wide range of situations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Transfers between spouses</strong> &mdash; Adding or removing a spouse from title due to marriage, divorce, or estate planning. These transfers are generally exempt from Pennsylvania realty transfer tax under 72 P.S. &sect; 8102-C.3.</li>
    <li><strong>Transfers to a trust</strong> &mdash; Moving property into a revocable living trust as part of an estate plan to avoid probate. When done correctly, these transfers are exempt from transfer tax and do not trigger reassessment.</li>
    <li><strong>Transfers to an LLC</strong> &mdash; Transferring rental or investment property into a limited liability company for asset protection. Tax exemption may apply when the same persons own 100% of the LLC, but this must be structured carefully to avoid an unexpected tax bill.</li>
    <li><strong>Parent-to-child transfers</strong> &mdash; Transferring property during lifetime, often to reduce estate size or transition a family home. These transfers may have transfer tax implications and should be coordinated with the parent's estate plan to avoid unintended gift tax or Medicaid lookback consequences.</li>
    <li><strong>Transfers after death</strong> &mdash; Executor's deeds and deeds from estates, including transfers pursuant to a will or intestacy. These are typically exempt from transfer tax under the family farm or decedent's estate exemptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Corrective deeds</strong> &mdash; Fixing errors in prior deeds such as misspelled names, incorrect legal descriptions, or missing signatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every deed transfer requires proper preparation, notarization, and recording with the county Recorder of Deeds. We also prepare the required Statement of Value (Rev-183) for the county and ensure that any applicable transfer tax exemptions are properly claimed. Our experience with both real estate and estate planning allows us to coordinate deed transfers with your broader legal strategy — whether that involves Medicaid planning, trust administration, or business restructuring.</p>

<h2>Commercial Leases</h2>
<p>A commercial lease is fundamentally different from a residential lease. There are fewer statutory protections for commercial tenants, which means the lease itself is the governing document — and every term matters. Our attorneys draft and negotiate commercial leases for landlords and tenants throughout Western Pennsylvania, addressing rent escalation clauses and CAM (Common Area Maintenance) charges, tenant improvement allowances and build-out responsibilities, assignment and subletting restrictions, personal guaranty obligations, options to renew or expand, early termination and default provisions, and insurance and indemnification requirements.</p>
<p>We also review commercial leases for clients who are entering into new tenancies or acquiring property subject to existing leases. Understanding the lease obligations before you commit — or before you buy — can prevent costly surprises down the road.</p>

<h2>Residential Leases</h2>
<p>A well-drafted lease is the foundation of a successful landlord-tenant relationship. Pennsylvania's Landlord and Tenant Act (68 P.S. &sect; 250.101 et seq.) governs residential leases and imposes specific requirements regarding security deposits, habitability, notice periods, and eviction procedures. Our attorneys draft residential leases that comply with Pennsylvania law, clearly define the rights and obligations of both parties, and include provisions that protect your investment.</p>
<p>We also review existing leases for clients who are acquiring rental property or renegotiating terms with tenants. Common issues we address include security deposit handling and return requirements under 68 P.S. &sect; 250.511a, maintenance and repair responsibilities, lease renewal and termination provisions, pet policies and property use restrictions, late fees, penalties, and remedies for default, and compliance with local housing codes and municipal ordinances.</p>

<h2>Landlord-Tenant Matters</h2>
<p>Disputes between landlords and tenants are an inevitable part of owning rental property. Our attorneys represent landlords in lease enforcement, non-payment proceedings, and evictions in the magisterial district courts throughout Westmoreland and Allegheny Counties. We also advise landlords on proper notice requirements, security deposit disputes, property damage claims, and compliance with fair housing laws.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania law imposes strict procedural requirements for evictions. Landlords must serve written notice to quit — ten days for leases of one year or more, fifteen days for verbal or at-will tenancies — before filing a complaint in the magisterial district court. Self-help evictions such as changing locks or shutting off utilities are illegal under Pennsylvania law and can expose landlords to significant liability. We ensure that every step is handled correctly so your case holds up in court.</p>

<h2>Property Tax Assessment Appeals</h2>
<p>If your property is over-assessed, you may be paying more in property taxes than you should. In Westmoreland County, property assessments are based on the county's base-year valuation, and the common level ratio (CLR) published annually by the State Tax Equalization Board determines the relationship between assessed value and fair market value. Our attorneys evaluate whether your assessment is accurate, gather supporting evidence including comparable sales data, and represent you before the county Board of Assessment Appeals.</p>
<p>A successful appeal can reduce your property tax burden for years to come, making it a worthwhile investment for homeowners, commercial property owners, and real estate investors alike.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Investment Guidance</h2>
<p>For clients who invest in real estate, we provide legal guidance on entity structuring for rental properties, acquisition and disposition of investment properties, 1031 like-kind exchange coordination, financing and lender negotiations, and property management agreements. We work closely with our clients' accountants and financial advisors to ensure that every real estate transaction is structured to maximize tax efficiency and minimize legal exposure.</p>

<h2>Boundary and Easement Disputes</h2>
<p>Disputes over property boundaries, shared driveways, fencing, and easements are common in Western Pennsylvania. These issues can affect your ability to use, improve, or sell your property. Our attorneys review surveys, deeds, and title records to determine your rights, and work to resolve boundary and easement disputes through negotiation or, when necessary, through appropriate legal action.</p>

<h2>How Real Estate Connects to Everything Else</h2>
<p>Real estate rarely exists in isolation. A family home is an estate planning asset. A rental property is a business asset. A commercial lease is a business obligation. A deed transfer after death is an estate administration task. At Ament Law Group, our attorneys practice across all four of these areas — estate planning, probate and trust administration, business law, and real estate — which means we see the connections that a single-practice attorney might miss.</p>
<p>When we transfer a property into a trust, we are thinking about your estate plan. When we structure a rental LLC, we are thinking about your business liability and your estate tax exposure. When we draft a commercial lease for your business, we are thinking about your succession plan. This integrated approach ensures that one area of your legal life does not create unintended problems in another.</p>

<h2>Situations We Handle</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Landlord facing chronic non-payment:</strong> We guide landlords through Pennsylvania's eviction process, from the required notice under 68 P.S. &sect; 250.501 through filing a complaint in magisterial district court, ensuring procedural compliance at every stage so the landlord's case holds up and possession is restored efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Over-assessed commercial property:</strong> A business owner discovers that their Westmoreland County property assessment exceeds fair market value by tens of thousands of dollars. We compile comparable sales data, retain an appraiser when necessary, and present the case to the Board of Assessment Appeals — often producing annual tax savings that far exceed our fees.</li>
    <li><strong>Parents transferring the family home to children:</strong> We advise on the best deed type, transfer tax exemptions, and potential Medicaid lookback implications. We coordinate the transfer with the parents' estate plan to ensure the overall strategy remains intact.</li>
    <li><strong>Investor structuring a rental portfolio:</strong> We advise real estate investors on whether to hold properties individually, in an LLC, or through a series of entities, weighing liability protection, tax treatment, financing implications, and the administrative requirements of each approach under Pennsylvania law.</li>
    <li><strong>Commercial tenant negotiating a lease:</strong> A small business owner needs help understanding a complex commercial lease with CAM charges, personal guaranty requirements, and an unclear renewal clause. We negotiate terms that protect the tenant's interests while maintaining a workable landlord relationship.</li>
    <li><strong>Neighbors disputing a shared driveway:</strong> When a neighbor blocks access to a shared driveway or challenges a long-standing easement, we research the deed chain, locate recorded easement agreements, and negotiate a resolution — or pursue a quiet title action if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How much does a deed transfer cost?</h3>
    <p>Our deed transfer fees are flat-rate and depend on the type of transfer and its complexity. A straightforward transfer between spouses or into a trust is typically our most affordable service. More complex transfers — such as those involving multiple parcels, transfer tax analysis, or coordination with estate or business planning — may cost more. We will always quote a fee before we begin work.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do I need to pay transfer tax when I move property into my trust?</h3>
    <p>Transfers to a revocable living trust where the grantor is the sole beneficiary during their lifetime are generally exempt from Pennsylvania realty transfer tax. However, the exemption must be properly claimed on the Statement of Value form, and the deed must be correctly drafted to qualify. We handle these transfers regularly and ensure the exemption is applied correctly.</p>

    <h3>What can I do if my tenant is not paying rent?</h3>
    <p>Pennsylvania law requires that landlords follow specific procedures before evicting a tenant for non-payment.

    <h3>Should I hold rental property in an LLC?</h3>
    <p>In most cases, holding rental property in a properly maintained LLC provides meaningful liability protection, separating your personal assets from risks associated with the property. However, an LLC adds administrative requirements and may affect your ability to obtain certain types of financing. We help investors weigh the pros and cons based on their specific portfolio, risk profile, and long-term goals.</p>

<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is the difference between a commercial lease and a residential lease?</h3>
    <p>Residential tenants are protected by Pennsylvania's Landlord and Tenant Act, which imposes requirements on security deposits, habitability, and eviction procedures. Commercial tenants have far fewer statutory protections — the lease itself is the primary governing document. This makes it critical for commercial tenants and landlords alike to have an attorney review the lease before signing.</p>
