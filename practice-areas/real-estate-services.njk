<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Real estate legal services</strong> extend beyond buying and selling property. Our attorneys handle lease drafting and review, landlord-tenant matters, property tax assessment appeals, boundary and easement disputes, and legal guidance for real estate investors. Whether you own a single rental property or a growing portfolio, we provide the legal support your real estate interests require.</p>
</div>

<h2>Lease Drafting and Review</h2>
<p>A well-drafted lease is the foundation of a successful landlord-tenant relationship. Pennsylvania's Landlord and Tenant Act (68 P.S. &sect; 250.101 et seq.) governs residential leases and imposes specific requirements regarding security deposits, habitability, notice periods, and eviction procedures. Our attorneys draft residential and commercial leases that comply with Pennsylvania law, clearly define the rights and obligations of both parties, and include provisions that protect your investment.</p>
<p>We also review existing leases for clients who are acquiring rental property or renegotiating terms with tenants. Common issues we address include security deposit handling and return requirements, maintenance and repair responsibilities, lease renewal and termination provisions, pet policies and property use restrictions, late fees, penalties, and remedies for default, and compliance with local housing codes and ordinances.</p>

<h2>Landlord-Tenant Matters</h2>
<p>Disputes between landlords and tenants are an inevitable part of owning rental property. Our attorneys represent landlords in lease enforcement, non-payment proceedings, and evictions in the magisterial district courts throughout Westmoreland and Allegheny Counties. We also advise landlords on proper notice requirements, security deposit disputes, property damage claims, and compliance with fair housing laws.</p>
<p>When disputes can be resolved without litigation, we pursue negotiated solutions that minimize cost and disruption. When court action is necessary, we move efficiently to protect your property rights and rental income.</p>

<h2>Property Tax Assessment Appeals</h2>
<p>If your property is over-assessed, you may be paying more in property taxes than you should. In Westmoreland County, property assessments are based on the county's base-year valuation, and the common level ratio (CLR) published annually by the State Tax Equalization Board determines the relationship between assessed value and fair market value. Our attorneys evaluate whether your assessment is accurate, gather supporting evidence including comparable sales data, and represent you before the county Board of Assessment Appeals.</p>
<p>A successful appeal can reduce your property tax burden for years to come, making it a worthwhile investment for homeowners, commercial property owners, and real estate investors alike.</p>

<h2>Real Estate Investment Guidance</h2>
<p>For clients who invest in real estate, we provide legal guidance on entity structuring for rental properties, acquisition and disposition of investment properties, 1031 like-kind exchange coordination, financing and lender negotiations, and property management agreements. We work closely with our clients' accountants and financial advisors to ensure that every real estate transaction is structured to maximize tax efficiency and minimize legal exposure.</p>

<h2>Boundary and Easement Disputes</h2>
<p>Disputes over property boundaries, shared driveways, fencing, and easements are common in Western Pennsylvania. These issues can affect your ability to use, improve, or sell your property. Our attorneys review surveys, deeds, and title records to determine your rights, and work to resolve boundary and easement disputes through negotiation or, when necessary, through appropriate legal action.</p>
