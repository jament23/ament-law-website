<div class="quick-answer">
<p>The VA's Aid and Attendance benefit provides monthly pension payments to eligible wartime veterans — and their surviving spouses — who need help with daily living activities or are in a care facility. It is one of the most valuable and underutilized benefits available to older veterans, and it requires careful planning to access properly. At Ament Law Group, we help veterans and their families evaluate eligibility, structure their affairs to qualify, and coordinate VA benefits with their overall estate plan.</p>

<h2>What Is Aid and Attendance?</h2>
<p>Aid and Attendance (A&amp;A) is an enhanced VA pension benefit available to wartime veterans and surviving spouses who meet both financial and medical eligibility requirements. Unlike disability compensation, Aid and Attendance is need-based — it is designed to help offset the cost of long-term care, assisted living, in-home care, and similar services.</p>

<p>The benefit is paid monthly and can provide meaningful financial relief to families managing care costs. As of 2025, the maximum monthly benefit is approximately $2,300 for a veteran with a dependent spouse, $1,500 for a single veteran, and $1,000 for a surviving spouse. These amounts are adjusted periodically by the VA.</p>

<h2>Basic Eligibility Requirements</h2>
<p>To qualify for Aid and Attendance, a veteran must meet several threshold requirements:</p>

<p><strong>Military service:</strong> The veteran must have served at least 90 days of active duty, with at least one day during a recognized wartime period. Wartime periods include World War II (December 7, 1941 – December 31, 1946), the Korean War (June 27, 1950 – January 31, 1955), the Vietnam War (August 5, 1964 – May 7, 1975 for most veterans), and the Gulf War (August 2, 1990 – present). The veteran must have received an honorable or other than dishonorable discharge.</p>

<p><strong>Medical need:</strong> The veteran or their spouse must require assistance with activities of daily living — such as bathing, dressing, eating, or medication management — due to physical or mental disability. Residency in an assisted living facility or nursing home generally satisfies this requirement. A physician's statement documenting the need for assistance is required.</p>

<p><strong>Financial eligibility:</strong> The veteran's income and net worth must fall within VA limits. The VA uses a net worth limit — currently $155,356 (adjusted annually) — that includes both income and assets. Assets transferred within three years of applying for Aid and Attendance may be subject to a penalty period, similar to the Medicaid lookback rule.</p>

<h2>The Three-Year Lookback: Why Timing Matters</h2>
<p>A significant planning consideration for Aid and Attendance is the VA's three-year lookback rule, which took effect in October 2018. Asset transfers made within 36 months of filing a pension application with Aid and Attendance are subject to a penalty period that delays benefit eligibility.</p>

<p>This means families who anticipate a veteran may need Aid and Attendance in the future should plan sooner rather than later. Assets transferred before the three-year window closes will not affect eligibility. Assets transferred after care is already needed may result in a penalty period during which no benefits are paid.</p>

<p>Understanding the interaction between the lookback period, the net worth limit, and permissible planning strategies requires experienced legal guidance. Not all asset transfers are treated the same way, and the rules differ in important respects from Pennsylvania's Medicaid lookback rules.</p>

<h2>Coordinating VA Benefits with Medicaid Planning</h2>
<p>Many families dealing with veterans' long-term care costs need to consider both VA Aid and Attendance and Pennsylvania Medicaid — sometimes at the same time. The two programs have different eligibility rules, different lookback periods, and different asset limits, and planning strategies that work for one program can inadvertently disqualify a veteran from the other.</p>

<p>For example, the VA's net worth limit is significantly higher than Medicaid's $2,400 asset limit, but the VA's three-year lookback is shorter than Medicaid's five-year lookback. An asset transfer designed to meet the VA's net worth threshold may still be within Medicaid's lookback period, causing a Medicaid penalty if nursing home care becomes necessary later.</p>

<p>Coordinating both programs requires a comprehensive view of the veteran's financial picture, health trajectory, and likely care needs. This is one of the areas where working with an experienced elder law attorney provides the most value — a plan that considers both programs from the outset can preserve significantly more assets than one that addresses each program in isolation.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning for Veterans</h2>
<p>Veterans often have estate planning considerations that are distinct from the general population:</p>

<p><strong>Beneficiary designations on VA life insurance:</strong> Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI) and Service Members' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) pass by beneficiary designation, not through the will. These designations should be reviewed as part of any comprehensive estate plan — outdated beneficiary designations on VA life insurance are among the most common estate planning oversights we see.</p>

<p><strong>Service-connected disability compensation:</strong> VA disability compensation is not subject to Pennsylvania inheritance tax and does not pass through the estate in the traditional sense. Understanding how these benefits interact with the overall estate plan is important for families who receive substantial VA disability payments.</p>

<p><strong>Burial benefits and survivor benefits:</strong> The VA provides burial benefits and certain survivor benefits that surviving spouses and dependents may be entitled to claim. Making sure your family knows about these benefits and how to access them is an often-overlooked component of veterans' estate planning.</p>

<p><strong>Powers of attorney for veterans:</strong> A durable power of attorney that specifically addresses VA benefits — including the authority to manage VA accounts, file VA claims, and act as a VA fiduciary — ensures your agent can manage these benefits if you become incapacitated.</p>
