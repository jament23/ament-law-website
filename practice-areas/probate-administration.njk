<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Probate</strong> is the legal process of administering a deceased person's estate in Pennsylvania. It involves filing the will with the Register of Wills, obtaining Letters Testamentary or Letters of Administration, inventorying assets, paying debts and taxes, and distributing the remaining estate to beneficiaries. Probate in Pennsylvania is governed by the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code (20 Pa.C.S. § 101 et seq.).</p>

<h2>What is Probate in Pennsylvania?</h2>
<p>When someone passes away in Pennsylvania, their estate typically goes through probate — a court-supervised process that ensures the decedent's debts are paid, taxes are filed, and assets are distributed to the proper beneficiaries. The process begins by filing the original will with the Register of Wills in the county where the decedent resided and petitioning for Letters Testamentary (if there is a will) or Letters of Administration (if there is no will).</p>
<p>Contrary to what many estate planning seminars suggest, probate in Pennsylvania is generally straightforward and affordable. For a typical estate — a home, a car, bank accounts, and retirement accounts under $1 million — total probate costs including filing fees, the inventory fee, and a Family Settlement Agreement run approximately $1,325. Pennsylvania does not require lengthy court hearings or expensive probate attorneys the way some other states do.</p>

<h2>How We Help Executors and Administrators</h2>
<p>Being named as executor or administrator of an estate is a significant responsibility. You are personally liable for the proper handling of estate assets, timely payment of debts and taxes, and accurate distribution to beneficiaries. Our attorneys guide executors and administrators through every phase of the process, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Probate Filing</strong> — Preparing and filing the petition for probate, obtaining Letters Testamentary or Letters of Administration, and handling all Register of Wills requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Estate Notice and Creditor Claims</strong> — Publishing the required estate notice in a newspaper of general circulation and the county legal journal, and sending direct notice to known creditors and beneficiaries.</li>
    <li><strong>Asset Inventory and Valuation</strong> — Identifying, securing, and valuing all estate assets as of the date of death, and filing the inventory with the Register of Wills.</li>
    <li><strong>Debt and Expense Payment</strong> — Reviewing and paying valid creditor claims, ongoing expenses such as mortgages and utilities, and funeral costs in accordance with Pennsylvania's priority of payment rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax Filings</strong> — Preparing the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (REV-1500), the decedent's final income tax returns, and any estate income tax returns (Form 1041). We advise on the 5% discount available for inheritance tax paid within three months of death.</li>
    <li><strong>Accounting and Distribution</strong> — Preparing a formal or informal accounting of all estate transactions, obtaining receipts and releases from beneficiaries, and making final distributions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Trust Administration</h2>
<p>If the decedent established a revocable living trust, the process of administering that trust after death is similar to probate in many respects — though it occurs outside the court system. The successor trustee must still identify and value trust assets, pay debts and taxes, provide notice to beneficiaries, and distribute assets according to the trust terms. Pennsylvania law still requires advertising the estate and starting the one-year creditor period even when assets are held in trust.</p>
<p>We advise successor trustees on their fiduciary duties, help them navigate the administrative requirements, and ensure that trust distributions are made properly and in accordance with the grantor's wishes.</p>

<h2>Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax</h2>
<p>Pennsylvania imposes an inheritance tax on most assets transferred at death. The rate depends on the relationship between the decedent and the beneficiary: 0% for surviving spouses, 4.5% for children and lineal descendants, 12% for siblings, and 15% for all others. Paying the tax within three months of death qualifies the estate for a 5% discount on the tax owed — a meaningful savings that we help every client take advantage of when possible.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes We Help You Avoid</h2>
<p>Executors and administrators often make costly errors without proper legal guidance. These include distributing assets before all debts and taxes are settled, failing to advertise the estate or notify creditors, missing the inheritance tax filing deadline, paying claims out of priority order, and failing to obtain proper releases from beneficiaries before distribution. Personal liability for these mistakes can fall directly on the executor.</p>
