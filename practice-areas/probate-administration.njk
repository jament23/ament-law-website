<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Probate in Pennsylvania</strong> is the legal process of administering a deceased person's estate through the Register of Wills. The process begins with filing the original will and a petition for grant of letters at the county courthouse, after which the Register issues Letters Testamentary (if there is a will) or Letters of Administration (if there is no will). The executor then obtains Short Certificates, marshals estate assets, pays debts and taxes — including the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax (due within nine months of death, with a 5% discount for early payment) — and distributes remaining assets to beneficiaries. Probate costs in Pennsylvania typically include Register of Wills filing fees, attorney fees, and executor compensation.</p>
