<h2>What is Probate?</h2>
<p>Probate is the legal process through which a deceased person's assets are distributed to heirs and beneficiaries, and any debts or taxes owed are settled. In Pennsylvania, this process typically occurs through the Register of Wills in the county where the decedent resided.</p>
<p>Whether you have been named as an executor in a will or need to be appointed as administrator of an estate, our attorneys guide you through every step of the process.</p>
<h2>Our Probate Services</h2>

<h2>Trust Administration</h2>
<p>If you have been named as a successor trustee, you have fiduciary obligations to manage and distribute trust assets according to the trust document. Our attorneys help trustees understand their duties, manage trust assets, and make distributions correctly.</p>
<h2>Why Work with an Attorney?</h2>
<p>Mistakes in probate can be costly—from missed tax deadlines to improper asset distributions. An experienced probate attorney ensures the estate is administered correctly, efficiently, and in compliance with Pennsylvania law.</p>
