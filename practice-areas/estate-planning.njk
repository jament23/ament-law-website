<h2>What is Estate Planning?</h2>
<p>Estate planning is the process of organizing your affairs to protect your family, preserve your assets, and ensure your wishes are carried out. A comprehensive estate plan gives you control over what happens to your property, your finances, and your healthcare decisions—both during your lifetime and after.</p>
<p>At Ament Law Group, we work with individuals and families to create customized estate plans that address their unique needs and goals. Our estate planning services include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Last Will and Testament</strong> — Directs how your assets will be distributed and names a guardian for minor children.</li>
    <li><strong>Revocable Living Trusts</strong> — Allows assets to pass to beneficiaries outside of probate, providing privacy and efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Durable Power of Attorney</strong> — Designates a trusted person to manage your financial affairs if you become incapacitated.</li>
    <li><strong>Living Wills & Healthcare Directives</strong> — Documents your healthcare preferences and appoints someone to make medical decisions on your behalf.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Estate Planning Matters in Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Without an estate plan, Pennsylvania's intestacy laws determine who inherits your assets—and the result may not reflect your wishes. A proper estate plan helps you avoid unnecessary probate costs, minimize tax exposure, protect assets for future generations, and provide for loved ones with special needs.</p>
<p>Whether your estate is simple or complex, having a plan in place gives you and your family peace of mind.</p>
<h2>Our Process</h2>
<p>We begin with a consultation to understand your family situation, goals, and concerns. From there, we draft a customized plan, review it with you in detail, and ensure everything is properly executed and funded. We also recommend periodic reviews to keep your plan current as life changes.</p>
