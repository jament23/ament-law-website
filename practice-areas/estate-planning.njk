<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Estate planning</strong> is the legal process of arranging for the management and distribution of your assets during your lifetime and after death. In Pennsylvania, a complete estate plan typically includes a Last Will and Testament, a revocable living trust (when appropriate), a durable power of attorney under 20 Pa.C.S. § 5601, and an advance healthcare directive. Without an estate plan, Pennsylvania's intestacy laws (20 Pa.C.S. § 2101 et seq.) determine who inherits your assets.</p>

<h2>What is Estate Planning?</h2>
<p>Estate planning is the process of organizing your affairs to protect your family, preserve your assets, and ensure your wishes are carried out. A comprehensive estate plan gives you control over what happens to your property, your finances, and your healthcare decisions — both during your lifetime and after.</p>
<p>At Ament Law Group, we work with individuals and families to create customized estate plans that address their unique needs and goals. Whether you are a young parent establishing guardianship for minor children, a business owner planning for succession, or a retiree looking to minimize tax exposure and preserve wealth for the next generation, our attorneys bring the experience and attention to detail your plan requires.</p>

<h2>Estate Planning Documents We Prepare</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Last Will and Testament</strong> — Directs how your assets will be distributed, names an executor to manage your estate, and designates a guardian for minor children. In Pennsylvania, a valid will must be signed by the testator and witnessed by two individuals under 20 Pa.C.S. § 2502.</li>
    <li><strong>Revocable Living Trusts</strong> — Allows assets to pass to beneficiaries outside of probate, providing privacy and efficiency. A trust can also provide management of assets if you become incapacitated, avoiding the need for a court-appointed guardian of your estate.</li>
    <li><strong>Durable Power of Attorney</strong> — Designates a trusted person to manage your financial affairs if you become incapacitated. Pennsylvania's power of attorney statute (20 Pa.C.S. § 5601) includes specific requirements and optional provisions that should be carefully considered.</li>
    <li><strong>Living Wills & Healthcare Directives</strong> — Documents your healthcare preferences and appoints a healthcare agent to make medical decisions on your behalf. Under Pennsylvania's Advance Directive for Health Care Act (20 Pa.C.S. § 5422), you can specify the types of treatment you do or do not want to receive.</li>
    <li><strong>Beneficiary Designation Review</strong> — Retirement accounts, life insurance policies, and payable-on-death accounts pass by beneficiary designation, not by your will. We review all designations to ensure they align with your overall plan.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Estate Planning Matters in Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Without an estate plan, Pennsylvania's intestacy laws determine who inherits your assets — and the result may not reflect your wishes. For example, if you are married with children from a prior relationship, intestacy law allocates a portion of your estate to your children rather than your surviving spouse receiving everything. These default rules can create unintended consequences for blended families, unmarried partners, and anyone with specific wishes about how their property should be distributed.</p>
<p>A proper estate plan helps you avoid unnecessary probate costs, minimize Pennsylvania inheritance tax exposure, protect assets for future generations, and provide for loved ones with special needs or spending concerns. It also ensures that someone you trust is authorized to make financial and medical decisions on your behalf if you become unable to do so.</p>

<h2>When Should You Create or Update an Estate Plan?</h2>
<p>Major life events are natural triggers for estate planning. You should consider creating or reviewing your plan after marriage or divorce, the birth or adoption of a child, purchasing a home or starting a business, a significant change in assets or financial circumstances, the death or incapacity of a named fiduciary, or a move to or from Pennsylvania. Even without a specific life change, we recommend reviewing your estate plan every three to five years to ensure it still reflects your goals and complies with current law.</p>

<h2>Our Process</h2>
<p>We begin with a consultation to understand your family situation, goals, and concerns. From there, we draft a customized plan, review it with you in detail, and ensure everything is properly executed and funded. For clients with trusts, we guide you through the process of retitling assets and updating beneficiary designations so the trust functions as intended. We also recommend periodic reviews to keep your plan current as life changes.</p>
