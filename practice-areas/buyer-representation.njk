<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Buyer representation</strong> means having an attorney advocate for your interests throughout the home-buying process &mdash; from reviewing the agreement of sale through closing. Unlike a real estate agent, an attorney provides legal advice, identifies contractual risks, and ensures your rights are protected at every stage of the transaction.</p>
</div>

<h2>Why Hire an Attorney When Buying a Home?</h2>
<p>Buying a home is one of the largest financial decisions most people will ever make, yet many buyers rely solely on a real estate agent to guide them through the process. While agents are skilled at finding properties and negotiating price, they are not licensed to provide legal advice. An attorney reviews the legal terms of your agreement of sale, identifies risks and contingencies that may affect your purchase, negotiates repairs, credits, and contract modifications on your behalf, conducts or reviews the title search to ensure clear ownership, and represents you at the settlement table.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, there is no requirement that a buyer be represented by an attorney. However, the agreement of sale is a legally binding contract, and the consequences of overlooking a problematic clause or missing a contractual deadline can be significant. Having an experienced attorney on your side ensures that your interests are fully protected.</p>

<h2>Our Buyer Representation Services</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Agreement of Sale Review</strong> &mdash; We review every provision of the agreement of sale before you sign, including contingencies for financing, inspection, appraisal, and sale of your current home. We identify provisions that may be unfavorable and recommend modifications.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspection and Repair Negotiation</strong> &mdash; After the home inspection, we help you evaluate the findings and negotiate repairs or credits with the seller. We draft amendment and counteroffer language that protects your interests.</li>
    <li><strong>Title Review</strong> &mdash; We review the title search results to identify any liens, encumbrances, easements, or boundary issues that could affect your ownership. If title defects are discovered, we work to resolve them before closing.</li>
    <li><strong>Closing Representation</strong> &mdash; We attend settlement with you, review the closing disclosure and settlement statement, explain every document you sign, and ensure that the transaction closes in accordance with the terms of your agreement.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Closing Support</strong> &mdash; After closing, we confirm that the deed and mortgage are properly recorded, the title policy is issued, and any post-closing obligations are completed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>First-Time Homebuyers</h2>
<p>If you are buying your first home, the process can feel overwhelming. There are dozens of documents to sign, unfamiliar legal terms to understand, and tight deadlines to meet. Our attorneys take the time to explain each step of the process, answer your questions in plain language, and make sure you feel confident and informed from offer to closing. We also coordinate with your lender and real estate agent to keep the transaction on track and resolve any issues that arise.</p>

<h2>What Does Buyer Representation Cost?</h2>
<p>Our buyer representation services are offered on a flat-fee basis, so you know exactly what to expect with no surprises. The cost of attorney representation is modest relative to the size of the transaction and the protection it provides. Many buyers find that having an attorney actually saves them money by identifying issues, negotiating credits, and avoiding costly mistakes that could have been prevented with proper legal review.</p>
