<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Buyer representation</strong> means having an attorney advocate for your interests throughout the home-buying process &mdash; from reviewing the agreement of sale through closing. Unlike a real estate agent, an attorney provides legal advice, identifies contractual risks, and ensures your rights are protected at every stage of the transaction.</p>
</div>

<h2>Why Hire an Attorney When Buying a Home?</h2>
<p>Buying a home is one of the largest financial decisions most people will ever make, yet many buyers rely solely on a real estate agent to guide them through the process. While agents are skilled at finding properties and negotiating price, they are not licensed to provide legal advice. An attorney reviews the legal terms of your agreement of sale, identifies risks and contingencies that may affect your purchase, negotiates repairs, credits, and contract modifications on your behalf, conducts or reviews the title search to ensure clear ownership, and represents you at the settlement table.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, there is no requirement that a buyer be represented by an attorney. However, the agreement of sale is a legally binding contract, and the consequences of overlooking a problematic clause or missing a contractual deadline can be significant. Having an experienced attorney on your side ensures that your interests are fully protected.</p>

<h2>Our Buyer Representation Services</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Agreement of Sale Review</strong> &mdash; We review every provision of the agreement of sale before you sign, including contingencies for financing, inspection, appraisal, and sale of your current home. We identify provisions that may be unfavorable and recommend modifications.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspection and Repair Negotiation</strong> &mdash; After the home inspection, we help you evaluate the findings and negotiate repairs or credits with the seller. We draft amendment and counteroffer language that protects your interests.</li>
    <li><strong>Title Review</strong> &mdash; We review the title search results to identify any liens, encumbrances, easements, or boundary issues that could affect your ownership. If title defects are discovered, we work to resolve them before closing.</li>
    <li><strong>Closing Representation</strong> &mdash; We attend settlement with you, review the closing disclosure and settlement statement, explain every document you sign, and ensure that the transaction closes in accordance with the terms of your agreement.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Closing Support</strong> &mdash; After closing, we confirm that the deed and mortgage are properly recorded, the title policy is issued, and any post-closing obligations are completed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>First-Time Homebuyers</h2>
<p>If you are buying your first home, the process can feel overwhelming. There are dozens of documents to sign, unfamiliar legal terms to understand, and tight deadlines to meet. Our attorneys take the time to explain each step of the process, answer your questions in plain language, and make sure you feel confident and informed from offer to closing. We also coordinate with your lender and real estate agent to keep the transaction on track and resolve any issues that arise.</p>

<h2>What Does Buyer Representation Cost?</h2>
<p>Our buyer representation services are offered on a flat-fee basis, so you know exactly what to expect with no surprises. The cost of attorney representation is modest relative to the size of the transaction and the protection it provides. Many buyers find that having an attorney actually saves them money by identifying issues, negotiating credits, and avoiding costly mistakes that could have been prevented with proper legal review.</p>
<h2>Buying in Western Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The Western Pennsylvania real estate market has its own unique characteristics that affect homebuyers. Municipal transfer taxes vary by location, some communities have occupancy permits or point-of-sale inspection requirements, and older homes may present issues with title history, boundary lines, or environmental concerns that require careful legal review. Our attorneys are familiar with the local requirements across Westmoreland, Allegheny, and surrounding counties and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks.</p>
<p>We also regularly work with buyers purchasing properties in specific situations that require additional legal attention, including estate sales where the property is being sold by an executor, short sales or foreclosure purchases with bank-imposed requirements, new construction where the agreement of sale differs significantly from a resale contract, and multi-family or investment property purchases where lease assignments and tenant issues must be addressed.</p>
<p>Each of these situations involves legal complexities that go beyond a standard home purchase. Having an attorney who has handled these transactions before ensures that you are protected and that the deal closes on time and on terms that are fair to you.</p>

<h2>Situations We Handle</h2>
<p>Our buyer representation practice covers the full spectrum of residential purchase scenarios in Western Pennsylvania:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Estate sale with title complications:</strong> A buyer finds the perfect home, but the seller is an executor who has not yet fully administered the estate. We verify that the executor has legal authority to sell, review the Letters Testamentary or Short Certificate, confirm that all heirs have been notified, and ensure that clear title can be delivered at closing.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspection reveals major structural issue:</strong> A home inspection uncovers foundation problems or a failing septic system. We negotiate repair credits, escrow holdbacks, or price reductions on the buyer's behalf — and when the issue is serious enough, we advise on whether to exercise the inspection contingency and walk away.</li>
    <li><strong>Seller's disclosure raises red flags:</strong> Pennsylvania's Real Estate Seller Disclosure Law (68 Pa.C.S. § 7301 et seq.) requires sellers to disclose known material defects. When a disclosure form reveals prior water intrusion, mold, or boundary disputes, we investigate the issue and negotiate appropriate protections before our client commits.</li>
    <li><strong>New construction delays and change orders:</strong> Builder contracts often contain one-sided provisions that favor the builder. We review the agreement before signing, negotiate fair provisions for delays, change order pricing, and warranty coverage, and represent the buyer at closing to ensure the final product matches what was promised.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do I need an attorney to buy a house in Pennsylvania?</h3>
    <p>Pennsylvania does not legally require buyer attorney representation, but having one is strongly recommended. A real estate attorney reviews the agreement of sale, identifies unfavorable terms, examines the title search for liens and encumbrances, and represents your interests at closing. The cost of attorney representation is modest compared to the protection it provides on what is likely the largest purchase of your life.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is title insurance and do I need it?</h3>
    <p>Title insurance protects you against losses from defects in the title to your property — such as undisclosed liens, forged documents, or errors in the public record — that existed before you purchased the home. A lender's policy is required by your mortgage company, but an owner's policy protects your equity in the property. We recommend an owner's policy for every buyer, and as licensed title agents through Chicago Title and First American, we issue both policies at competitive rates.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What are closing costs for a buyer in Pennsylvania?</h3>
    <p>Buyer closing costs in Pennsylvania typically include the transfer tax (1% of the purchase price, split equally between buyer and seller unless otherwise negotiated), title insurance premiums, recording fees, lender fees, prepaid taxes and insurance, and attorney fees. We provide a detailed estimate of your closing costs early in the process so there are no surprises at the settlement table.</p>
