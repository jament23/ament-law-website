<p><strong>Selling your home without a realtor?</strong> You can save thousands in commission — but you still need the legal side handled right.

Our flat-fee pricing means you know exactly what you'll pay, with no surprises.</p>

<h2>Why FSBO Sellers Need an Attorney</h2>
<p>When you sell without a realtor, there's no one managing the paperwork, compliance, and legal protections that a transaction requires. A real estate attorney fills that gap — and in Pennsylvania, it's often the most important decision a FSBO seller makes.</p>
<p>Here's why: the agreement of sale is a binding legal contract. It dictates your obligations, your liability, and what happens if something goes wrong. The standard PAR forms weren't designed for FSBO transactions, and a poorly drafted agreement can expose you to claims for defects you didn't disclose, contingencies you didn't negotiate, or deadlines you didn't realize existed.</p>
<p>An attorney drafts the agreement to protect <em>you</em> — not to close the deal at any cost.</p>

<h2>What We Handle for FSBO Sellers</h2>
<p>We provide end-to-end legal support so you can focus on finding a buyer and negotiating the price. We handle the rest:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Agreement of Sale</strong> — We draft a custom agreement of sale tailored to your transaction, including appropriate contingencies, timelines, and protections. If the buyer presents their own agreement, we review it before you sign.</li>
    <li><strong>Seller's Property Disclosure</strong> — Pennsylvania law (68 Pa.C.S. § 7301) requires sellers to complete a detailed disclosure statement. We walk you through it to ensure accuracy and completeness, which is your best defense against post-sale claims.</li>
    <li><strong>Lead-Based Paint Disclosure</strong> — Required by federal law for any home built before 1978. We provide the forms and make sure you're in compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Title Search & Title Insurance</strong> — As licensed title agents through Chicago Title and First American, we conduct the title search, resolve any issues, and issue title insurance to protect both you and the buyer.</li>
    <li><strong>Deed Preparation</strong> — We draft the deed to transfer ownership, ensuring it accurately reflects the transaction and is recorded properly with the county.</li>
    <li><strong>Municipal Lien Letters & Tax Certifications</strong> — We order the required certifications to confirm all taxes and municipal liens are current.</li>
    <li><strong>Settlement Coordination & Closing</strong> — We coordinate with the buyer's lender (if applicable), prepare the settlement statement, conduct the closing, and handle recording of the deed and mortgage satisfaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You Save — and What It Costs</h2>
<p>A typical 6% real estate commission on a $300,000 home is $18,000. Even if the buyer has an agent earning 3%, you're still saving the listing agent's 3% — that's $9,000 back in your pocket.</p>
<p>Our flat legal fees for FSBO transactions are a fraction of that savings. You get full legal protection for your transaction at a predictable cost. Call us at <a href="tel:724-733-3500">(724) 733-3500</a> for current pricing — we're happy to quote your specific situation.</p>

<h2>Pennsylvania Transfer Taxes</h2>
<p>Every real estate sale in Pennsylvania is subject to a 2% transfer tax — 1% to the state and 1% to the local municipality. By custom, this is typically split equally between buyer and seller (1% each). On a $300,000 sale, that's $3,000 per party.</p>
<p>Your agreement of sale should clearly state how transfer taxes are allocated. We make sure this is addressed up front so there are no surprises at closing.</p>

<h2>Common FSBO Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<p>In our experience, the most costly mistakes FSBO sellers make aren't about pricing — they're about paperwork:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Signing the buyer's agreement without review</strong> — Buyer-drafted agreements protect the buyer. Have your attorney review or draft the agreement before you sign anything.</li>
    <li><strong>Incomplete disclosures</strong> — Skipping or rushing the Seller's Disclosure creates liability that can follow you for years. When in doubt, disclose.</li>
    <li><strong>Missing deadlines</strong> — Contingency deadlines, inspection periods, and mortgage commitment dates are legally binding. Miss one and the buyer may have grounds to walk away — or worse, hold you to the deal on their terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Forgetting about the use & occupancy inspection</strong> — Many municipalities in Westmoreland and Allegheny Counties require a U&O inspection before transfer. Failing to schedule one can delay closing.</li>
    <li><strong>Not verifying the buyer's financing</strong> — A pre-approval letter is not a commitment. Your agreement should include a mortgage contingency with a deadline, and you should understand the difference.</li>
    <li><strong>Handling earnest money improperly</strong> — Earnest money deposits must be held in an escrow account — not your personal account. An attorney or title company holds these funds until closing.</li>
</ul>
