<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Elder law</strong> encompasses the legal issues that affect older adults, including Medicaid planning, asset protection, guardianship, and long-term care planning. In Pennsylvania, Medicaid eligibility for long-term care is governed by the Department of Human Services and requires careful planning to protect assets while qualifying for benefits. Our attorneys help families navigate these complex rules with clarity and compassion.</p>

<h2>What is Elder Law?</h2>
<p>Elder law is a broad area of practice that addresses the unique legal needs of aging individuals and their families. It includes planning for long-term care costs, protecting assets from the expense of nursing home care, establishing guardianships for incapacitated adults, and ensuring that older adults receive the benefits and protections they are entitled to under Pennsylvania and federal law.</p>
<p>At Ament Law Group, our elder law practice is built around helping families make informed decisions during some of the most stressful times in their lives. Whether a loved one is facing a sudden health crisis or you are planning ahead for future care needs, we provide practical, experienced guidance tailored to your family's specific situation.</p>

<h2>Medicaid Planning in Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that pays for long-term care for individuals who meet strict income and asset limits. In Pennsylvania, the asset limit for a Medicaid applicant is $2,400, though the community spouse (the spouse who remains at home) may retain certain assets up to the Community Spouse Resource Allowance (CSRA). Medicaid also imposes a five-year look-back period on asset transfers, meaning that gifts or transfers made within five years of applying for Medicaid may result in a penalty period of ineligibility.</p>
<p>Effective Medicaid planning requires a thorough understanding of these rules and the strategies available to protect assets legally. Our attorneys help clients with spend-down strategies, exempt asset planning, caregiver agreements, irrevocable trust planning for those with sufficient lead time, and crisis planning when nursing home care is needed immediately.</p>

<h2>Guardianship</h2>
<p>When an adult becomes incapacitated and has not executed a durable power of attorney or healthcare directive, it may be necessary to petition the court for the appointment of a guardian. Pennsylvania's guardianship statute (20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5501 et seq.) provides for guardianship of the person, guardianship of the estate, or both. The process involves filing a petition, providing notice to the alleged incapacitated person and their family, and a hearing before the Orphans' Court.</p>
<p>We represent families seeking guardianship and guide them through the court process with sensitivity and efficiency. We also counsel families on alternatives to guardianship, including supported decision-making and limited guardianship arrangements that preserve as much of the individual's autonomy as possible.</p>

<h2>Long-Term Care Planning</h2>
<p>The cost of nursing home care in Pennsylvania averages over $12,000 per month, and these costs can quickly deplete a lifetime of savings. Planning ahead &mdash; ideally five or more years before care is needed &mdash; gives families the most options for protecting assets while ensuring access to quality care. Even when care is needed immediately, crisis planning strategies can often preserve a significant portion of the family's assets.</p>
<p>Our long-term care planning services include reviewing your current estate plan for Medicaid implications, analyzing asset ownership and beneficiary designations, exploring long-term care insurance options, and developing a comprehensive plan that balances care needs with asset preservation.</p>
