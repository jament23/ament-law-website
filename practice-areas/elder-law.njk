<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Elder law in Pennsylvania</strong> encompasses legal planning for aging, long-term care, and Medicaid eligibility. Pennsylvania Medicaid has a five-year look-back period, meaning asset transfers made within five years of applying for Medicaid can result in a penalty period of ineligibility. Effective Medicaid planning — including irrevocable trusts, spousal protections, and exempt asset strategies — should begin well before any anticipated need for nursing home care. Pennsylvania nursing home costs average $10,000-$14,000 per month, making advance planning critical to preserving family assets.</p>
