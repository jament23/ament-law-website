<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Elder law</strong> encompasses the legal issues that affect older adults, including Medicaid planning, asset protection, guardianship, and long-term care planning. In Pennsylvania, Medicaid eligibility for long-term care is governed by the Department of Human Services and requires careful planning to protect assets while qualifying for benefits. Our attorneys help families navigate these complex rules with clarity and compassion.</p>
</div>

<h2>What is Elder Law?</h2>
<p>Elder law is a broad area of practice that addresses the unique legal needs of aging individuals and their families. It includes planning for long-term care costs, protecting assets from the expense of nursing home care, establishing guardianships for incapacitated adults, and ensuring that older adults receive the benefits and protections they are entitled to under Pennsylvania and federal law.</p>
<p>At Ament Law Group, our elder law practice is built around helping families make informed decisions during some of the most stressful times in their lives. Whether a loved one is facing a sudden health crisis or you are planning ahead for future care needs, we provide practical, experienced guidance tailored to your family's specific situation.</p>

<h2>Medicaid Planning in Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that pays for long-term care for individuals who meet strict income and asset limits. In Pennsylvania, the asset limit for a Medicaid applicant is $2,400, though the community spouse (the spouse who remains at home) may retain certain assets up to the Community Spouse Resource Allowance (CSRA). Medicaid also imposes a five-year look-back period on asset transfers, meaning that gifts or transfers made within five years of applying for Medicaid may result in a penalty period of ineligibility.</p>
<p>Effective Medicaid planning requires a thorough understanding of these rules and the strategies available to protect assets legally. Our attorneys help clients with spend-down strategies, exempt asset planning, caregiver agreements, irrevocable trust planning for those with sufficient lead time, and crisis planning when nursing home care is needed immediately.</p>

<h2>Guardianship</h2>
<p>When an adult becomes incapacitated and has not executed a durable power of attorney or healthcare directive, it may be necessary to petition the court for the appointment of a guardian. Pennsylvania's guardianship statute (20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5501 et seq.) provides for guardianship of the person, guardianship of the estate, or both. The process involves filing a petition, providing notice to the alleged incapacitated person and their family, and a hearing before the Orphans' Court.</p>
<p>We represent families seeking guardianship and guide them through the court process with sensitivity and efficiency. We also counsel families on alternatives to guardianship, including supported decision-making and limited guardianship arrangements that preserve as much of the individual's autonomy as possible.</p>

<h2>Long-Term Care Planning</h2>
<p>The cost of nursing home care in Pennsylvania averages over $12,000 per month, and these costs can quickly deplete a lifetime of savings. Planning ahead &mdash; ideally five or more years before care is needed &mdash; gives families the most options for protecting assets while ensuring access to quality care. Even when care is needed immediately, crisis planning strategies can often preserve a significant portion of the family's assets.</p>
<p>Our long-term care planning services include reviewing your current estate plan for Medicaid implications, analyzing asset ownership and beneficiary designations, exploring long-term care insurance options, and developing a comprehensive plan that balances care needs with asset preservation.</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Medicaid in Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Families frequently ask us whether Medicaid will take their home. In most cases, your primary residence is an exempt asset for Medicaid eligibility purposes while you or your spouse lives there. However, the state may seek recovery from your estate after death through the estate recovery program. Proper planning can protect the home from estate recovery in many situations.</p>
<p>Another common concern is whether it is too late to plan. While five years of lead time provides the most options, crisis planning strategies can still preserve a significant portion of your assets even when nursing home care is needed immediately. The key is to consult with an experienced elder law attorney as soon as possible — every day of delay can cost your family money.</p>
<p>We also advise families on the interaction between Medicaid planning and existing estate plans. Changes to asset ownership, beneficiary designations, or trust structures made for Medicaid purposes must be coordinated with your will, power of attorney, and other estate planning documents to avoid unintended consequences.</p>

<h2>Situations We Handle</h2>
<p>Every elder law case involves a unique combination of family dynamics, financial circumstances, and timing. Here are the types of situations we regularly assist families with:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sudden nursing home admission:</strong> A parent suffers a stroke and is transferred to a skilled nursing facility. The family has no Medicaid plan and assets exceed the eligibility limit. We implement crisis planning strategies — including community spouse protections, exempt asset conversions, and caregiver agreements — to preserve as much of the family's assets as possible while securing Medicaid coverage.</li>
    <li><strong>Adult child seeking guardianship:</strong> A parent with advancing dementia never executed a power of attorney. The family needs legal authority to manage finances, make medical decisions, and prevent exploitation. We petition the Westmoreland County Orphans' Court for appointment of a guardian and navigate the hearing process with care for the family's dignity and the individual's remaining autonomy.</li>
    <li><strong>Proactive five-year Medicaid plan:</strong> A healthy couple in their late sixties wants to protect their home and savings in case either spouse eventually needs long-term care. We design an irrevocable trust and asset protection strategy that preserves eligibility while ensuring the couple maintains access to income and continues living in their home.</li>
    <li><strong>Protecting the community spouse:</strong> When one spouse enters a nursing home, the community spouse is entitled to keep certain assets and income. We calculate the Community Spouse Resource Allowance, review whether the Monthly Maintenance Needs Allowance is adequate, and take steps to maximize the community spouse's financial security.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Will Medicaid take my house?</h3>
    <p>Your primary residence is generally an exempt asset for Medicaid eligibility while you or your spouse lives there. However, Pennsylvania's Department of Human Services may seek recovery from your estate after death through its estate recovery program. With proper planning — such as transferring the home to an irrevocable trust or utilizing other strategies — we can often protect the home from estate recovery. The key is planning ahead, ideally at least five years before care is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Is it too late to do Medicaid planning if my parent is already in a nursing home?</h3>
    <p>No. While five years of lead time provides the most flexibility, crisis planning strategies can still preserve a meaningful portion of the family's assets. These strategies may include spend-down planning, purchasing exempt assets, establishing compliant annuities, or utilizing community spouse protections. Every day matters, so consulting with an elder law attorney as soon as possible after admission is essential.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is the difference between a guardianship and a power of attorney?</h3>
    <p>A power of attorney is a document you sign voluntarily while you have capacity, designating someone to act on your behalf. A guardianship is a court proceeding initiated after someone has already become incapacitated and cannot manage their own affairs. Guardianship is more expensive, more time-consuming, and more restrictive than a power of attorney. This is why we strongly recommend executing a durable power of attorney and healthcare directive as part of every estate plan — to avoid the need for guardianship entirely.</p>
