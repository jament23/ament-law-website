<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Business legal services</strong> encompass the ongoing legal needs of established businesses, from contract drafting and review to corporate governance, buy-sell agreements, and general counsel. At Ament Law Group, we serve as outside general counsel for businesses throughout Western Pennsylvania, providing experienced legal guidance without the cost of a full-time in-house attorney.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ongoing Legal Support for Your Business</h2>
<p>Once your business is formed, the legal needs do not stop. Every contract you sign, every employee you hire, every partnership you enter, and every major decision you make carries legal implications. Having an attorney who understands your business and is available when you need guidance helps you avoid costly mistakes and operate with confidence.</p>
<p>At Ament Law Group, we serve as outside general counsel for small and mid-sized businesses across Westmoreland County and Western Pennsylvania. Our clients include professional practices, family-owned businesses, real estate investors, contractors, and retail operations. We take the time to understand your business so we can provide advice that is practical, timely, and tailored to your specific needs.</p>

<h2>Our Business Services</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Contract Drafting and Review</strong> &mdash; We draft, review, and negotiate contracts including vendor agreements, service contracts, leases, independent contractor agreements, non-compete and non-disclosure agreements, and partnership or joint venture agreements.</li>
    <li><strong>Corporate Records and Governance</strong> &mdash; We help businesses maintain proper corporate records including meeting minutes, resolutions, and amendments to governing documents. Maintaining these records is essential to preserving your entity's liability protection.</li>
    <li><strong>Buy-Sell Agreements</strong> &mdash; A buy-sell agreement defines what happens to a business owner's interest upon death, disability, retirement, or departure. These agreements are critical for businesses with multiple owners and should be coordinated with each owner's estate plan and life insurance coverage.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Succession Planning</strong> &mdash; Whether you plan to pass your business to the next generation, sell to a third party, or wind down operations, we help you develop a succession plan that protects your interests and minimizes tax exposure.</li>
    <li><strong>Mergers and Acquisitions</strong> &mdash; We represent buyers and sellers in business transactions, handling due diligence, asset purchase agreements, stock purchase agreements, and post-closing integration.</li>
    <li><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong> &mdash; When business disputes arise, we work to resolve them efficiently through negotiation, mediation, or, when necessary, litigation referral to trusted trial counsel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Outside General Counsel?</h2>
<p>Many small and mid-sized businesses cannot justify the expense of a full-time in-house attorney, but they still need reliable legal guidance on a regular basis. As your outside general counsel, we provide the same level of strategic legal support at a fraction of the cost. You have a dedicated attorney who knows your business, your industry, and your goals &mdash; and who is available when you need advice, whether it is reviewing a contract, navigating a regulatory issue, or planning a major transaction.</p>

<h2>Integrating Business and Estate Planning</h2>
<p>For business owners, estate planning and business planning are inseparable. Your business is likely one of your most valuable assets, and a proper estate plan must account for business succession, buy-sell agreement funding, key-person insurance, and the tax implications of transferring a business interest at death or during your lifetime. Our attorneys bring experience in both areas, allowing us to create a coordinated plan that protects your business, your family, and your legacy.</p>
