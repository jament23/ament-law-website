<div class="quick-answer">
<p><strong>Business legal services</strong> encompass the ongoing legal needs of established businesses, from contract drafting and review to corporate governance, buy-sell agreements, and general counsel. At Ament Law Group, we serve as outside general counsel for businesses throughout Western Pennsylvania, providing experienced legal guidance without the cost of a full-time in-house attorney.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ongoing Legal Support for Your Business</h2>
<p>Once your business is formed, the legal needs do not stop. Every contract you sign, every employee you hire, every partnership you enter, and every major decision you make carries legal implications. Having an attorney who understands your business and is available when you need guidance helps you avoid costly mistakes and operate with confidence.</p>
<p>At Ament Law Group, we serve as outside general counsel for small and mid-sized businesses across Westmoreland County and Western Pennsylvania. Our clients include professional practices, family-owned businesses, real estate investors, contractors, and retail operations. We take the time to understand your business so we can provide advice that is practical, timely, and tailored to your specific needs.</p>

<h2>Our Business Services</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Contract Drafting and Review</strong> &mdash; We draft, review, and negotiate contracts including vendor agreements, service contracts, leases, independent contractor agreements, non-compete and non-disclosure agreements, and partnership or joint venture agreements.</li>
    <li><strong>Corporate Records and Governance</strong> &mdash; We help businesses maintain proper corporate records including meeting minutes, resolutions, and amendments to governing documents. Maintaining these records is essential to preserving your entity's liability protection.</li>
    <li><strong>Buy-Sell Agreements</strong> &mdash; A buy-sell agreement defines what happens to a business owner's interest upon death, disability, retirement, or departure. These agreements are critical for businesses with multiple owners and should be coordinated with each owner's estate plan and life insurance coverage.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Succession Planning</strong> &mdash; Whether you plan to pass your business to the next generation, sell to a third party, or wind down operations, we help you develop a succession plan that protects your interests and minimizes tax exposure.</li>
    <li><strong>Mergers and Acquisitions</strong> &mdash; We represent buyers and sellers in business transactions, handling due diligence, asset purchase agreements, stock purchase agreements, and post-closing integration.</li>
    <li><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong> &mdash; When business disputes arise, we work to resolve them efficiently through negotiation, mediation, or, when necessary, litigation referral to trusted trial counsel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Outside General Counsel?</h2>
<p>Many small and mid-sized businesses cannot justify the expense of a full-time in-house attorney, but they still need reliable legal guidance on a regular basis. As your outside general counsel, we provide the same level of strategic legal support at a fraction of the cost. You have a dedicated attorney who knows your business, your industry, and your goals &mdash; and who is available when you need advice, whether it is reviewing a contract, navigating a regulatory issue, or planning a major transaction.</p>

<h2>Integrating Business and Estate Planning</h2>
<p>For business owners, estate planning and business planning are inseparable. Your business is likely one of your most valuable assets, and a proper estate plan must account for business succession, buy-sell agreement funding, key-person insurance, and the tax implications of transferring a business interest at death or during your lifetime. Our attorneys bring experience in both areas, allowing us to create a coordinated plan that protects your business, your family, and your legacy.</p>
<h2>Industries We Serve</h2>
<p>Our business clients come from a wide range of industries throughout Western Pennsylvania. We represent medical and dental practices navigating partnership agreements and regulatory compliance, construction contractors managing subcontractor agreements and lien rights, real estate investors structuring acquisitions and property management arrangements, family-owned businesses planning for generational transitions, technology startups establishing intellectual property protections and founder agreements, and retail and service businesses handling lease negotiations and employment matters.</p>
<p>Regardless of your industry, the fundamental legal needs are similar: clear contracts, proper entity maintenance, liability protection, and a plan for the future. We bring decades of experience serving businesses in Westmoreland and Allegheny Counties, and we understand the practical challenges small business owners face every day.</p>
<p>Many of our business clients also rely on us for their personal estate planning needs. Because we understand both sides of the equation — your business and your family — we can create coordinated plans that protect both. A buy-sell agreement that does not align with your estate plan, or an estate plan that does not account for your business interests, leaves gaps that can create serious problems for your family and your partners.</p>

<h2>Situations We Handle</h2>
<p>Our business law clients come to us with real-world challenges that require practical solutions, not just legal advice:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Partner exit dispute:</strong> When one partner wants out and the other wants to continue the business, we negotiate buyout terms, value the departing partner's interest, and draft a separation agreement that protects the ongoing operations — or, when an operating agreement is already in place, we enforce its buy-sell provisions to reach a fair resolution.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer contract going sideways:</strong> A service provider discovers that a client is withholding payment over a disputed deliverable. We review the contract terms, advise on breach remedies under Pennsylvania's Uniform Commercial Code, and work toward collection — through demand letters, negotiation, or litigation referral when necessary.</li>
    <li><strong>Business owner's death without a succession plan:</strong> The surviving family has no operating agreement and no clear authority to run the business. We step in to stabilize operations through the probate process, assist with estate administration of the business interest, and help the family decide whether to continue, sell, or wind down.</li>
    <li><strong>Franchise or acquisition due diligence:</strong> A client considering the purchase of an existing business needs thorough review of financial records, contracts, pending litigation, regulatory compliance, and employee agreements before committing. We conduct legal due diligence and structure the transaction to allocate risk appropriately.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do I need a lawyer to review a business contract?</h3>
    <p>You should have a lawyer review any contract that involves significant financial obligations, ongoing commitments, or potential liability. This includes commercial leases, vendor and supplier agreements, independent contractor arrangements, non-compete clauses, and any contract that limits your rights or exposes you to indemnification obligations. Reviewing a contract before you sign it is far less expensive than litigating a dispute after the fact.</p>

<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is outside general counsel and how does it work?</h3>
    <p>Outside general counsel is an arrangement where your business has a dedicated attorney available for ongoing legal needs without the cost of hiring a full-time in-house lawyer. We handle contract review, compliance questions, employment issues, and strategic legal decisions as they arise. Most of our business clients contact us on an as-needed basis, while others schedule regular check-ins to stay ahead of legal issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How do I plan for business succession?</h3>
    <p>Business succession planning starts with identifying your goals — whether you want to transition the business to family, sell to a third party, or prepare for an eventual wind-down. From there, we coordinate your business structure, buy-sell agreements, estate plan, and tax strategy to create a unified plan. The earlier you start, the more options you have and the smoother the transition will be for everyone involved.</p>
