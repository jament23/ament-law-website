            <p>Most people who have estate planning documents believe those documents will work when needed. Some are right. Many are not — and they have no way of knowing the difference. The Peace-of-Mind Review is a free consultation where we examine your existing will, trust, powers of attorney, and healthcare documents and give you an honest assessment of whether they accomplish what you intend.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Documents Fail — More Often Than You'd Think</h2>
        <p>Every week we see estate planning documents that were prepared by attorneys, downloaded from the internet, or generated by online services — documents that look finished, sound authoritative, and will not work when it matters. The problems are rarely obvious to the person holding the document. They are obvious to us.</p>

        <p>The most common problems we find:</p>

        <h3>Execution Errors</h3>
        <p>Pennsylvania has specific requirements for how estate planning documents must be signed. A will requires two witnesses — and those witnesses cannot be individuals who stand to inherit under the will. A power of attorney requires both a notary and two witnesses, along with a specific statutory notice that must be signed before the agent can act. Healthcare directives have their own signature requirements.</p>
        <p>Documents that were not executed correctly are not legally valid — period. It does not matter how well the document is drafted if the signing ceremony was done wrong. We see this most often with documents that were signed at home without attorney supervision, notarized at a bank without proper witnesses, or generated by an online service that provided instructions the client did not follow precisely.</p>

        <h3>Language That Doesn't Reflect Your Wishes</h3>
        <p>Generic document templates use generic language. Generic language is designed to cover the average situation — which means it often does not cover your situation. We regularly find wills that leave assets "in equal shares to my children" without addressing what happens if a child predeceases the testator. We find trusts that distribute assets to a beneficiary outright at age 25 when the client actually wanted staggered distributions. We find powers of attorney that grant broad financial authority but omit the specific language needed to allow the agent to make Medicaid planning transfers on the principal's behalf — a gap that can cost families hundreds of thousands of dollars when a nursing home crisis occurs.</p>
        <p>If you have not read your documents carefully — with someone who can explain what the language actually means in Pennsylvania — you may not know what you agreed to.</p>

        <h3>Missing Backup Designations</h3>
        <p>What happens if your primary executor cannot serve? What if your agent under your power of attorney predeceases you, or becomes incapacitated themselves? What if your primary beneficiary dies before you do?</p>
        <p>Documents that name only a primary designee with no successor create gaps that can require court intervention to fill. We frequently see powers of attorney with no successor agent named — documents that become useless if anything happens to the primary agent. A properly drafted estate plan anticipates these contingencies and names successors for every critical role.</p>

        <h3>Sensitive Information That Should Not Be There</h3>
        <p>A will becomes a public document when it is filed for probate — anyone can read it at the courthouse. Despite this, we regularly see wills that include Social Security numbers, account numbers, specific financial balances, medical diagnoses, and other sensitive personal information that has no business in a publicly filed document.</p>
        <p>Healthcare powers of attorney present a different problem. We see documents that include detailed medical history, specific diagnoses, and other health information embedded in the document itself — information that will be handed to hospital staff, insurance companies, and other parties who have no need for it.</p>
        <p>Your estate planning documents should accomplish their legal purpose without becoming a roadmap to your identity or medical history.</p>

        <h3>Healthcare Directives That Don't Say What You Think</h3>
        <p>Healthcare powers of attorney and living wills are the documents most often completed incorrectly — and the documents most likely to matter in an emergency. The most common problems we find:</p>
        <p>Sections left blank. Many healthcare directive forms have optional sections that clients skip over, not realizing those sections determine what happens in specific medical situations. A blank section is not a neutral choice — it often means the document is silent on something important.</p>
        <p>Conflicting instructions. A living will that says "withhold life-sustaining treatment" combined with a healthcare power of attorney that gives the agent "full authority to consent to any medical treatment" creates a conflict that puts your healthcare agent in an impossible position.</p>
        <p>Agent designations without alternates. If your designated healthcare agent is unavailable in a crisis — and crises happen without warning — a document with no successor agent leaves medical providers without legal authority to take direction from anyone.</p>
        <p>We review every section of your healthcare documents to make sure they are internally consistent, fully completed, and clearly express what you actually want.</p>

        <h2>What to Bring</h2>
        <p>Bring whatever documents you have. That might include your will, a revocable living trust and pour-over will, a durable power of attorney, a healthcare power of attorney, a living will or advance directive, or any combination of the above. If you had documents prepared by another attorney, an online service, or a seminar organization, bring those. If you are not sure what you have, bring everything and we will sort it out.</p>
        <p>You do not need to prepare anything in advance. We will review the documents during the consultation and walk you through what we find.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>
        <p>At the end of the Peace-of-Mind Review, you will know:</p>
        <p>Whether your documents are legally valid under current Pennsylvania law. Whether they actually accomplish what you intend. What specific problems exist, if any, and how serious they are. What it would cost to fix them, if anything needs to be fixed — quoted in writing, before you commit to anything.</p>
        <p>There is no sales pitch and no pressure. If your documents are in good shape, we will tell you that and send you on your way. If they need work, you will know exactly what and why — and you can decide whether to address it with us or take that information elsewhere.</p>
